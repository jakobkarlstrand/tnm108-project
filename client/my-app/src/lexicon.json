Watch now . Hadean has teamed up with Microsoft Azure to provide cloud-enabled training and simulation for defense and intelligence work in the United Kingdom. The companies plan to provide the defense industrial base with scalable, interoperable, and secure cloud-based military training tech. Hadean aimes to integrate its “metaverse” infrastructure with Microsoft Azure to produce custom and rugged solutions that can deliver realtime data to government agencies, defense contractors and the armed forces around the world. I asked what Hadean thinks of critics who say working for defense and intelligence purposes is unethical business. I’ll update the story if they answer. “Microsoft is a trusted partner in defence and intelligence with a track-record of delivering secure cloud services that empower system integrators and transform capabilities to meet the requirements of modern militaries,” said Hadean CEO, Craig Beddis, in a statement. “We’re excited to deepen our relationship with a new collaboration and combine our expertise to push the limit of what is possible with cloud computing, enhance Microsoft Azure and pioneer capabilities for military training and simulation.” Hadean and Microsoft have already worked together to build, run, and deliver a cloud distributed simulation to the British Army Collective Training Transformation Programme (CTTP). It will be demoed at set at the I/ITSEC 2022 Innovation Center on November 30 at 11:20 am GMT. “Working closely with innovative technology providers is a critical way that we bring new capability to defence and intelligence missions,” said Gus MacGregor-Millar, general manager of worldwide defense & intelligence at Microsoft, in a statement. “Having supported Hadean in its early growth years through the Microsoft for Start-Ups programme, we are pleased to collaborate further with them to help allied defence customers harness the full potential of cloud-based training and simulation solutions and realise mission impact through next-generation capabilities.” Founded in 2015, Hadean wants to provide the infrastructure and computational power required to realise the full potential of the metaverse. Hadean is also working with Microsoft’s Minecraft, Epic Games, Sony, Gamescoin, Pixelynx, CAE, BAE Systems, Thales and Francis Crick Institute.

Apple unveiled the winners of the 2022 App Store Awards, with Respawn’s Apex Legends Mobile winning iPhone Game of the Year . The awards spotlight 16 apps and games that inspired users to engage more deeply with the world, expand their imaginations, and stay connected to friends and loved ones, Apple said. Apple judged the games and awards on technological innovation, user experience and design. This year’s winners represent a diverse community of developers from solo developers to big companies around the world whose apps and games were selected by Apple’s global App Store editorial team for delivering exceptional experiences and making a profound cultural impact. “This year’s App Store Award winners reimagined our experiences with apps that delivered fresh, thoughtful, and genuine perspectives,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, in a statement. “From self-taught solo creators to international teams spanning the globe, these entrepreneurs are making a meaningful impact and represent the ways in which apps and games influence our communities and lives.” Apex Legends Mobile won the top iPhone game for bringing the fast-paced hit battle royale game to the iPhone. Moncage, the top iPad game, forces users to see things from different perspectives to solve puzzles, and the immersive card battler Inscryption (top Mac game) draws players in with experimental storytelling. El Hijo, a Wild West tale, is a smartly designed stealth game for Apple TV. Apple Arcade’s unique life-sim Wylde Flowers invites players into its charming world of diverse characters and magical spells, and League of Legends Esports Manager allows players to manage the most influential esports leagues in the world. As for non-game apps, Apple said the social app BeReal gives users an authentic look into the lives of their family and friends, and fitness tracker Gentler Streak helps users balance fitness and rest to maintain a healthy lifestyle. GoodNotes 5 takes digital note-taking to the next level with best-in-class Apple Pencil support. MacFamilyTree 10 sparks the exploration of genealogy through visual family trees and collaboration with loved ones around the world, while the creators behind ViX: Cine y TV en Español elevate Spanish-language stories to the forefront of entertainment. iPhone Game of the Year: Apex Legends Mobile , from Electronic Arts “It’s heavily inspired by the hit game on console and PC, but it is a completely different product,” said Myke Hoff, senior director of product at Respawn Entertainment, in an interview with GamesBeat. “Our goal with the game is to have something that’s easy to pick up and play with a very high mastery curve to keeps you coming back.” The idea was to bring Apex Legends to a new set of gamers and add to the diverse backstories of characters in the Apex Legends universe. The game still has 60 players in a match. But mobile players do not play with console or PC gamers, given the differences in controls. “Rather than porting the Legends, we took a look at each one and really focused on how to make them the most fun for players on their phones,” said Kevin Childress, creative director at Respawn Entertainment, in an interview with GamesBeat. ” So players have called out some of the changes on their favorites like Crypto and Octane being welcome additions and changes to the franchise. And we’ve also taken great efforts developing mobile-first Legends to expand the Apex roster.” Respawn built the game with help from Tencent, and it tweaked things like progression for mobile players as needed. And since a lot of players play the game without sound, the team changed the game so it had more visual cues for players. EA hasn’t disclosed how many players the game has. And tomorrow, the company is starting the seventh season for the mobile game. iPad Game of the Year: Moncage , from X.D. Network “We aim at creating games for our people, regardless of age, identities, aesthetics and languages speak and bring the unforgettable experienced your players,” said Dong Zhou, co-developer of Moncage, in an interview with GamesBeat. “We wanted to make a game that can truly all and inspire people.” Zhou co-developed the game with Yijia Chen. They started while going to school in New York and eventually moved to Irvine, California. Now they have a team of five and are working on a new game. Moncage was their first game, created with the mission of showing that gameplay can be completely based on a game’s visuals. The game creates optical illusions, and you can solve puzzles by looking from a different perspective into a 3D cube. The art is handcrafted. It is a story about a veteran who is having nightmares and suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. “The main theme of Moncage is about breaking free and finding true peace,” said Chen, in an interview. Mac Game of the Year: Inscryption , from Devolver. For Inscryption, Mark Hickey, vice president of mobile publishing at Devolver Digital, spoke on behalf of the lone creator, Daniel Mullins. Hickey said the Mac version is the same as the PC and console versions. “The way the game starts is you wake up to find yourself in this old, creepy, creaky cabin in the woods,” Hickey said. “And there’s this strange a table set up in front of you. And there’s this strange looking card game laid out on the table and an even stranger and creepier-looking opponent sitting across from you who may or may not be your captor.” He added, “So he starts by teaching you how to play you know, and explains the rules and you play a couple of hands and then things seem straightforward at first, and you may think you’re actually sort of getting the hang of it after winning the first hand and then he gives you this rusty bloody pair of pliers that hint that nothing nothing good is on the way.” Devolver is known for bizarre games. “When Daniel first approached us to publish an inscription, I mean the whole thing made us so terribly uncomfortable. It was an instant yes,” Hickey said. “The stakes are high because they’re measured in blood and sometimes even teeth. Every choice you make can have dire consequences. So if you play wisely and carefully and learn the systems and and cards, you will progress and you’ll become more powerful and you know soon you will eventually be able to get up from the table and explore your your creepy cabin in the woods prison.” Hickey said inspirations include games like Magic: The Gathering, Telling Lies, and Her Story as well as movies like The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield. Hickey said it is rare to see solo developer teams today, but he also believes it is easier than ever to make games because of the availability of tools. Apple TV Game of the Year: El Hijo , from HandyGames. Apple Arcade Game of the Year: Wylde Flowers , from Studio Drydock Pty Ltd. China Game of the Year: League of Legends Esports Manager , from Tencent. iPhone App of the Year: BeReal , from BeReal. iPad App of the Year: GoodNotes 5 , from Time Base Technology Limited. Mac App of the Year: MacFamilyTree 10 , from Synium Software GmbH. Apple TV App of the Year: ViX: Cine y TV en Español , from TelevisaUnivision Interactive, Inc.

        "description": "The performer, who died at the age of 63, sang about the price of fame. And paid it",
        "content": "-- Shares Facebook Twitter Reddit Email view in app Her voice was the voice of the 1980s : ragged, with a raw touch of intensity, of desperation, but also, soaring and victorious. Triumphant. This was the voice of someone who swore they would make it. And did. But the world makes you make it again and again, requires you to prove yourself endlessly until the end. Irene Cara sang the theme song for the 1980 film \" Fame \"— and she was fame embodied, America's favorite myth of hard work and perseverance. All myths have dark sides, difficult lessons and truths. Cara died on Thursday at the age of 63, her publicist Judith A. Moose confirmed. CNN and others reported Cara died at her home in Florida. A cause of death has not yet been released. Wanting to be a singer and performer, I watched \"Fame\" over and over as a child, perhaps as a cautionary tale. The film, following students attending what was then known as New York's the High School of Performing Arts from audition through graduation, is not short on nudity, abuse, drug references, homophobia and racism. But in a sea of talented and struggling kids, Cara shone as the best. Her character is a singer, pianist and dancer — a triple threat, as Cara was too. She will always embody the time period of my childhood, but more that, Cara will forever be the voice of ambition, singing of the pull and power of desire, of fighting for and getting exactly what you want. Related From \"Stranger Things\" to TikTok: Kate Bush speaks to lonely kids. Here's why Cara was born Irene Escalera on March 18, 1959 in the Bronx. (The year was a subject of some dispute, as The New York Times reported.) The daughter of a Puerto Rican factory worker and musician, and a Cuban cashier, she was a finalist in the child pageant \"Little Miss America\" and started performing young on Spanish-language television. She attended the Professional Children's School in Manhattan, ironically, a school mocked by the public school students in \"Fame.\" By 13, she appeared regularly on the children's public television program \" The Electric Company .\" After appearing in \"Sparkle\" and \"Roots: The Next Generation,\" she was barely older than a teenager when she starred as Coco Hernandez in \"Fame,\" the film for which she also sang the title song. Four years later, in 1984, she earned an Oscar and Golden Globe for co-writing \"Flashdance . . . What a Feeling,\" the title track of the Jennifer Beals film \"Flashdance.\" Her vocal performance also won her a Grammy. Cara's other awards include an NAACP Image Award, a Billboard Year-End Award and multiple Grammy Awards and nominations. Irene Cara, star of the hit movie \"Fame,\" on the Soul Train stage, episode 337, aired 10/4/1980. (Soul Train via Getty Images) As Coco in \"Fame,\" Cara is a driven and determined young star. She does the work, poring over trade magazines. She's also practical, convincing a fellow student to start a band with her because the gigs are steady and she's interested in managing their business. Her character has a pure love of art, all art. She's the first one to start singing the cafeteria improv \" Hot Lunch Jam ,\" the music flowing from her. She dances spontaneously in a puddle in the subway station after school. Coco's earnest love carries the movie. Cara's voice is the film's connective thread, as resonant in the emotional piano ballad \" Out Here On my Own \" as in the rousing title track with its disco beats. Coco's journey is also the most compelling. Out of all the students, she's real. \"Take your passion/And make it happen\" felt less like a catchy phrase and more like a prayer. \"I'm just killing time here, waiting for my opportunity,\" she explains, matter-of-factly. \"It's coming. I keep my eyes open.\" Despite her no-nonsense attitude (she calls herself \"a professional\" and says, knowingly, \"life comes down hard\"), Coco's open eyes are also wide. Too wide. Her character pays a price for ambition. A young woman of color, she's preyed upon by an older white man who lies to her, telling her he's a filmmaker when in reality, he sexually exploits her. It's the most difficult scene to get through in the often-grim film, Cara weeping on the black and white viewfinder of the predator's camera, and it's one of the last scenes too. Coco's story is not resolved. We see her next and only at graduation, when she sings resolutely. If there's a happy ending, we don't know it. Though \"Flashdance\" is Beals' film, a star-making turn where Beals plays a steelworker by day and bar dancer who dreams of dance school at night, Cara is its voice, and as such, its beating but broken heart. How many kids danced to \" Flashdance . . . What a Feeling ,\" twirling about like Beals (or her stand-ins ) in their bedrooms? We couldn't have yet known the years, hard work and heartache behind lyrics like, \"I can have it all, now I'm dancing for my life,\" but we believed her forceful truth. \"Take your passion/And make it happen\" felt less like a catchy phrase and more like a prayer, a spell Cara was casting of dreams. Bruno Martelli (Lee Curreri) tries to convince Coco Hernandez (Irene Cara) that they should form a rock band, in a scene from 'Fame', directed by Alan Parker, 1980. (United Artists/Archive Photos/Getty Images) Both \"Flashdance\" and \"Fame\" are about working class young people trying to make it in the performing arts, not exactly known as a welcoming stage to anyone but the rich and connected. But \"Make it happen,\" Cara purred. Cara remained a star who burned brightly and young. She did make it happen for herself, releasing six studio albums and appearing on dozens of other albums and soundtracks. But her own sitcom, NBC's 1981 \" Irene ,\" was never picked up by the network. She acted on stage and on screen, but dealt with intense legal troubles after filing a lawsuit against her former record company in 1985, accusing them of withholding her royalties. Almost a decade later, she was finally awarded $1.5 million . People reported that in that time, \"she fled the spotlight, mired in an eight-year legal battle. . . and disenchanted by the experience.\" Cara said she lost her savings to the lawsuit, telling People the music world \"virtually blacklisted [me]. All of a sudden, I was hearing stories about how difficult I was to work with, ridiculous rumors about drugs and what a diva I was.\" Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter , Crash Course. She performed, including voiceover roles in films, but a band she formed in the late '90s, Hot Caramel, only released one album. Cara remained a star who burned brightly and young. That kind of fatalism tinges her early hits, like in \"Fame\" when she swears \"I'm gonna live forever.\" It's stirring because you know it's fleeting. Power like that radiates hot and fast.

        "content": "Did you miss a session from GamesBeat Summit Next 2022? All sessions are now available for viewing in our on-demand library. Click here to start watching . Cyber Monday shopping sales hit at least $6.3 billion through part of the day in the U.S. today, according to the latest online shopping data from Adobe Analytics. It’s not unusual for Cyber Monday and Black Friday online shopping results to break records, but it this economic climate it’s encouraging to see it happen. Still, growth has slowed from 2021 and 2020 holiday seasons. Consumers spent $6.3 billion up through 3:00 pm Pacific time for Cyber Monday. Adobe expects that when the final tally is in, consumers will spend between $11.2 billion and $11.6 billion for the day, making Cyber Monday the biggest online shopping day of the year (and of all time). Today, the top 15 hot sellers (not in ranked order) have included Legos, Hatchimals, Disney Encanto, Pokémon cards, Bluey, Dyson products, strollers, Apple Watches, drones, and digital cameras. Gaming consoles also remain popular, along with games including Mario Party, FIFA 23, Madden 23 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II. Over the past weekend, the top sellers were included Hot Wheels, Cocomelon, Bluey, Disney Encanto, L.O.L. Surprise dolls, Roblox, and Fortnite in the toys category. Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 remain the top selling gaming consoles, with popular games including FIFA 23, God of War Ragnarök, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Madden 23, and NBA 2k23. Other hot sellers included Apple iPads, Apple MacBooks, digital cameras, Roku devices, drones, gift cards and Instapots. Black Friday online shopping sales were $9.12 billion, up 2.3% from a year ago, and Thanksgiving itself came in at $5.29 billion, up 2.9% from a year ago. Those were above Adobe’s projections. Last year, consumers spent $10.7 billion on Cyber Monday. Strong consumer spend has been driven by net-new demand, and not just higher prices. The Adobe Digital Price Index, which tracks online prices across 18 product categories (complements the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index, which also includes prices for offline only products and services like gasoline and rent) shows that prices online have been nearly flat in recent months (down 0.7% YoY in October 2022). Adobe’s numbers are not adjusted for inflation, but if online inflation were factored in, there would still be growth in underlying consumer demand, the company said. On a category basis, toys were a major growth driver in the days leading up to Cyber Monday, with online sales up 452% over the average day in October 2022. Appliances (up 305%) and baby/toddler products (up 289%) also saw strong demand, in addition to electronics (up 276%) and apparel (up 258%). Shoppers will find record discounts today for computers (peaking at 27% off listed price). Deals will also be found in nearly all categories tracked, including apparel (19%), toys (33%), electronics (25%), sporting goods (16%), televisions (15%), and furniture (11%). Those looking to buy an appliance should consider waiting until Thursday (December 1), when discounts are set to peak at 18% on average. Consumers spent over a Black Friday’s worth of ecommerce over the weekend at $9.55 billion, up 4.4% YoY ($4.59 billion on November 26, up 2.6% YoY / $4.96 billion on November, up 6.1% YoY). Season-to-date (November 1 to November 27), consumers have spent a total of $96.42 billion online, up 2.1% YoY. And while the big days (Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday) have reached new heights, consumers spent at record levels all season. Since November 1, shoppers spent over $2 billion every single day, with 19 days above $3 billion in online spend. Broad, early discounts were the main drivers for the shift in consumer spending. “Shoppers have seen massive discounts this past week, which is the exact opposite situation from last season when supply chain constraints kept prices elevated,” said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, in a statement. “While discounting will have an impact on margins for retailers, it is also driving a level of demand that can help brands build long-term loyalty and net some short-term gains.” Over the weekend, online sales of toys were up 383% (compared to average daily sales for the category in October 2022), with baby toys seeing strong demand (up 252%). Other categories that surged over the weekend include jewelry (up 230%), sporting goods (up 239%), and apparel (up 217%). With online spending hitting new records and inflation impacting consumers, flexible payments have become a big story this season. In the last week (November 21 to November 27), “buy now, pay later” orders have risen 68% and revenue has increased 72%, when compared to the week prior. Over the weekend, smartphones drove over half of online sales for the first time (52%, up from 48% last year). Adobe expects mobile shopping to dip on Cyber Monday however, based on historical trends. Many people are back at work and using laptops, which will be the preferred device for shopping online. Adobe expects Cyber Week (the five days from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday) to generate $34.8 billion in online spend, up 2.8% YoY, and represent 16.3% share of the full November through December holiday season. Cyber Monday is expected to remain the season’s and year’s biggest online shopping day, bringing in between $11.2 billion and $11.6 billion. Black Friday generated a record $9.12 billion in online spend, up 2.3% YoY, while Thanksgiving brought $5.29 billion in online spend, up 2.9% YoY. Adobe analyzes direct consumer transactions online. The analysis covers over one trillion visits to U.S. retail sites, 100 million SKUs, and 18 product categories.

        "description": "A few key tips to help you build a secure and privacy-focused data cloud using Snowflake.",
        "content": "Check out the on-demand sessions from the Low-Code/No-Code Summit to learn how to successfully innovate and achieve efficiency by upskilling and scaling citizen developers. Watch now . Today, Snowflake is the favorite for all things data. The company started as a simple data warehouse platform a decade ago but has since evolved into an all-encompassing data cloud supporting a wide range of workloads, including that of a data lake . More than 6,000 enterprises currently trust Snowflake to handle their data workloads and produce insights and applications for business growth. They jointly have more than 250 petabytes of data on the data cloud, with more than 515 million data workloads running each day. Now, when the scale is this big, cybersecurity concerns are bound to come across. Snowflake recognizes this and offers scalable security and access control features that ensure the highest levels of security for not only accounts and users but also the data they store. However, organizations can miss out on certain basics, leaving data clouds partially secure. Here are some quick tips to fill these gaps and build a secure enterprise data cloud. Intelligent Security Summit Learn the critical role of AI & ML in cybersecurity and industry specific case studies on December 8 . Register for your free pass today . First of all, all organizations using Snowflake, regardless of size, should focus on using secured networks and SSL/TLS protocols to prevent network-level threats. According to Matt Vogt, VP for global solution architecture at Immuta , a good way to start would be connecting to Snowflake over a private IP address using cloud service providers’ private connectivity such as AWS PrivateLink or Azure Private Link. This will create private VPC endpoints that allow direct, secure connectivity between your AWS/Azure VPCs and the Snowflake VPC without traversing the public Internet. In addition to this, network access controls, such as IP filtering, can also be used for third-party integrations, further strengthening security. While Snowflake offers multiple layers of protection – like time travel and fail-safe – for data that has already been ingested, these tools cannot help if the source data itself is missing, corrupted or compromised (like malicious encrypted for ransom) in any way. This kind of issue, as Clumio’s VP of product Chadd Kenney suggests, can only be addressed by adopting measures to protect the data when it is resident in an object storage repository such as Amazon S3 – before ingest. Further, to protect against logical deletes, it is advisable to maintain continuous, immutable, and preferably air-gapped backups that are instantly recoverable into Snowpipe. Enterprises should use SCIM (system for cross-domain identity management) to help facilitate automated provisioning and management of user identities and groups (i.e. roles used for authorizing access to objects like tables, views, and functions) in Snowflake. This makes user data more secure and simplifies the user experience by reducing the role of local system accounts. Plus, by using SCIM where possible, enterprises will also get the option to configure SCIM providers to synchronize users and roles with active directory users and groups. On top of this, enterprises also should use multi-factor authentication to set up an additional layer of security. Depending on the interface used, such as client applications using drivers, Snowflake UI, or Snowpipe, the platform can support multiple authentication methods, including username/password, OAuth, keypair, external browser, federated authentication using SAML and Okta native authentication. If there’s support for multiple methods, the company recommends giving top preference to OAuth (either snowflake OAuth or external OAuth) followed by external browser authentication and Okta native authentication and key pair authentication. Organizations should use Snowflake’s dynamic data masking and external tokenization capabilities to restrict certain users’ access to sensitive information in certain columns. For instance, dynamic data masking, which can dynamically obfuscate column data based on who’s querying it, can be used to restrict the visibility of columns based on the user’s country, like a U.S. employee can only view the U.S. order data, while French employees can only view order data from France. Both features are pretty effective, but they use masking policies to work. To make the most of it, organizations should first determine whether they want to centralize masking policy management or decentralize it to individual database-owning teams, depending on their needs. Plus, they would also have to use invoker_role() in policy conditions to enable unauthorized users to view aggregate data on protected columns while keeping individual data hidden. Finally, organizations should not forget to implement a unified audit model to ensure transparency of the policies being implemented. This will help them actively monitor policy changes, like who created what policy that granted user X or group Y access to certain data, and is as critical as monitoring query and data access patterns. To view account usage patterns, use system-defined, read-only shared database named SNOWFLAKE. It has a schema named ACCOUNT_USAGE containing views that provide access to one year of audit logs.

        "description": "AI and ML are core to zero trust, strengthening cybersecurity by scaling data analysis volume while increasing response speeds.",
        "content": "Check out the on-demand sessions from the Low-Code/No-Code Summit to learn how to successfully innovate and achieve efficiency by upskilling and scaling citizen developers. Watch now . Faced with an onslaught of malware-less attacks that are increasingly hard to identify and stop, CISOs are contending with a threatscape where bad actors innovate faster than security and IT teams can keep up. However, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are proving effective in strengthening cybersecurity by scaling data analysis volume while increasing response speeds and securing digital transformation projects under construction. “AI is incredibly, incredibly effective in processing large amounts of data and classifying this data to determine what is good and what’s bad. At Microsoft, we process 24 trillion signals every single day, and that’s across identities and endpoints and devices and collaboration tools, and much more. And without AI, we simply could not tackle this,” Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president for Microsoft security, compliance, identity, and privacy, told her keynotes’ audience at the RSA Conference earlier this year. 2022 is a breakout year for AI and ML in cybersecurity. Both technologies enable cybersecurity and IT teams to improve the insights, productivity and economies of scale they can achieve with smaller teams. 93% of IT executives are already using or considering implementing AI and ML to strengthen their cybersecurity tech stacks. Of those, 64% of IT executives have implemented AI for security in at least one of their security life cycle processes, and 29% are evaluating vendors. CISOs tell VentureBeat that one of the primary factors driving adoption is the need to get more revenue-related projects done with fewer people. In addition, AI and ML-based apps and platforms are helping solve the cybersecurity skills shortages that put organizations at a higher risk of breaches. According to the (ISC)² Cybersecurity Workforce Study , “3.4 million more cybersecurity workers are needed to secure assets effectively.” Intelligent Security Summit Learn the critical role of AI & ML in cybersecurity and industry specific case studies on December 8 . Register for your free pass today . CISOs also need the real-time data insights that AI- and ML-based systems provide to fine-tune predictive models, gain a holistic view of their networks and continue implementing their zero-trust security framework and strategy. As a result, enterprise spending on AI- and ML-based cybersecurity solutions are projected to attain a 24% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2027 and reach a market value of $46 billion . It’s common to find enterprises not tracking up to 40% of their endpoints , making it more challenging because many IT teams aren’t sure how many endpoints their internal processes are creating in a given year. Over a third, or 35%, of enterprises using AI today to strengthen their tech stacks say that endpoint discovery and asset management is their leading use case. Enterprises plan to increase their use of endpoint discovery and asset management by 15% in three years, eventually installed in nearly half of all enterprises. It’s understandable why endpoint recovery and asset management are highly prioritized due to how loosely managed their digital certificates are. For example, Keyfactor found that 40% of enterprises use spreadsheets to track digital certificates manually, and 57% do not have an accurate inventory of SSH keys. Additional use cases revolve around cybersecurity investments related to zero-trust initiatives, including vulnerability and patch management, access management and identity access management (IAM). For example, 34% of enterprises are using AI-based vulnerability and patch management systems today, which is expected to jump to over 40% in three years. Over 11,700 companies in Crunchbase are affiliated with cybersecurity, with over 1,200 mentioning AI and ML as core tech stacks and products and service strategies. As a result, there’s an abundance of cybersecurity vendors to consider, and over a thousand can use AL, ML or both to solve security problems. CISOs look to AI and ML cybersecurity vendors who can most help consolidate their tech stacks first. They’re also looking for AI and ML applications, systems and platforms that deliver measurable business value while being feasible to implement, given their organizations’ limited resources. CISOs are getting quick wins using this approach. The most common use cases are AI- and ML-based cybersecurity implementations of transaction-fraud detection, file-based malware detection, process behavior analysis, and web domain and reputation assessment. CISOs want AI and Ml systems that can identify false positives and differentiate between attackers and admins. That’s because they meet the requirement of securing threat vectors while delivering operational efficiency and being technically feasible. VentureBeat’s conversations with CISOs at industry events, including RSA , BlackHat 2022 , CrowdStrike’s Fal.Con and others, found several core areas where AI and ML adoption continue to get funded despite budget pressures being felt across IT and security teams. These areas include behavioral analytics (now a core part of many cybersecurity platforms), bot-based patch management, compliance, identity access management (IAM), identifying and securing machine identities, and privileged access management (PAM), where AI is used for scoring risk and validating identities. In addition, the following are areas where AI and ML are delivering value to enterprises today: Using AL and ML to improve behavioral analytics, improving authentication accuracy. Endpoint protection platform (EPP), endpoint detection and response (EDR) unified endpoint management (UEM), and a few public cloud providers, including Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and others, are combining AI techniques and ML models to improve security personalization while enforcing least-privileged access. Leading cybersecurity providers are integrating predictive AI and ML to adapt security policies and roles to each user in real time based on the patterns of where and when they attempt to log in, their device type, device configuration and several other classes of variables. Leading providers include Blackberry Persona , Broadcom , CrowdStrike , CyberArk , Cybereason , Ivanti , SentinelOne , Microsoft , McAfee , Sophos , VMware Carbon Black and others. Enterprises say this approach to using AI-based endpoint management decreases the risk of lost or stolen devices, protecting against device and app cloning and user impersonation. Discovering and securing endpoints by combining ML and natural language processing (NLP). Attack surface management (ASM) is comprised of external attack surface management (EASM), cyberasset attack surface management (CAASM), and digital risk protection services (DRPS), according to Gartner’s 2022 Innovation Insight for Attack Surface Management report (preprint courtesy of Palo Alto Networks). Gartner predicts that by 2026, 20% of companies will have more than 95% visibility of all their assets, which will be prioritized by risk and control coverage by implementing CAASM functionality, up from less than 1% in 2022. Leading vendors in this area are combining ML algorithms and NLP techniques to discover, map and define endpoint security plans to protect every endpoint in an organization. Leading vendors include Axonius, Brinqa, Cyberpion, CyCognito, FireCompass, JupiterOne, LookingGlass Cyber, Noetic Cyber, Palo Alto Networks (via its acquisition of Expanse), Randori and others. Using AI and ML to automate indicators of attack (IOAs), thwarting intrusion and breach attempts. AI-based IOAs fortify existing defenses using cloud-based ML and real-time threat intelligence to analyze events at runtime and dynamically issue IOAs to the sensor. The sensor then correlates the AI-generated IOAs (behavioral event data) with local events and file data to assess maliciousness. CrowdStrike says AI-powered IOAs operate asynchronously alongside existing layers of sensor defense, including sensor-based ML and existing IOAs. Its AI-based IOAs combine cloud-native ML and human expertise on a common platform invented by the company more than a decade ago. Since their introduction, AI-based IOAs have proven effective in identifying and thwarting intrusion and breach attempts while defeating them in real time based on actual adversary behavior. AI-powered IOAs rely on cloud-native ML models trained using telemetry data from CrowdStrike Security Cloud combined with expertise from the company’s threat-hunting teams. IOAs are analyzed at machine speed using AI and ML, providing the accuracy, speed and scale enterprises need to thwart breaches. “CrowdStrike leads the way in stopping the most sophisticated attacks with our industry-leading indicators of attack capability, which revolutionized how security teams prevent threats based on adversary behavior, not easily changed indicators,” said Amol Kulkarni, chief product and engineering officer at CrowdStrike. “Now, we are changing the game again with the addition of AI-powered indicators of ttack, which enable organizations to harness the power of the CrowdStrike Security Cloud to examine adversary behavior at machine speed and scale to stop breaches in the most effective way possible.” AI-powered IOAs have identified over 20 never-before-seen adversary patterns, which experts have validated and enforced on the Falcon platform for automated detection and prevention. AI and ML techniques enrich bot-based patch management with contextual intelligence. One of the most innovative areas of cybersecurity today is how the leading cybersecurity providers rely on a combination of AI and ML techniques to locate, inventory and patch endpoints that need updates. Vendors aim to improve bots’ predictive accuracy and ability to identify which endpoints, machines and systems need patching when evaluating the need to take an inventory-based approach to patch management. Ivanti’s recent survey on patch management found that 71% of IT and security professionals found patching overly complex and time-consuming, and 53% said that organizing and prioritizing critical vulnerabilities takes up most of their time. Patch management needs to be more automated if it’s going to be an effective deterrent against ransomware. Taking a data-driven approach to ransomware helps. Nayaki Nayyar, president and chief product officer at Ivanti, is a leading thought leader in this area and has often presented how the most common software errors can lead to ransomware attacks. During RSA, her presentation on how Ivanti Neurons for Risk-Based Patch Management provides contextual intelligence that includes visibility into all endpoints, including those that are cloud- and on-premises based, all from a unified interface, reflects how advanced bot-based match management is coming using AI as a technology foundation. Using AI and ML to improve UEM for every device and machine identity. UEM platforms vary in how advanced they are in capitalizing on AI and Ml technologies when protecting them with least-privileged access. The most advanced UEM platforms can integrate with and help enable enterprise-wide microsegmentation, IAM and PAM. AI and ML adoption across enterprises happens fastest with these technologies embedded in platforms and, in the case of Absolute Software , in the firmware of the endpoint devices. The same holds true for UEM for machine identities. By taking a direct, firmware-based approach to managing machine-based endpoints to enable real-time OS, patch and application updates that are needed to keep each endpoint secure, CISOs gain the visibility and control of endpoints they need. Absolute Software’s Resilience , the industry’s first self-healing zero-trust platform, is noteworthy for its asset management, device and application control, endpoint intelligence, incident reporting and compliance, according to G2 Crowds’ crowdsourced ratings . Ivanti Neurons for UEM relies on AI-enabled bots to seek out machine identities and endpoints and automatically update them unprompted. Ivanti’s approach to self-healing endpoints is also worth noting for how well its UEM platform approach combines AI, ML and bot technologies to deliver unified endpoint and patch management at scale across a global enterprise customer base. Additional vendors rated highly by G2 Crowd include CrowdStrike Falcon , VMware Workspace ONE and others. Every enterprise’s zero-trust security roadmap will be as unique as its business model and approach. A zero-trust network access (ZTNA) framework needs to be able to flex and change quickly as the business it’s supporting changes direction. Longstanding tech stacks that sought security using interdomain controllers and implicit trust proved too slow to react and be responsive to changing business requirements. Relying on implicit trust to connect domains was also an open invitation to a breach. What’s needed are cloud-based security platforms that can interpret and act on network telemetry data in real time. CrowdStrike’s Falcon platform, Ivanti’s approach to integrating AI and ML across their product lines, and Microsoft’s approach on Defender365 and their build-out of the functionality on Azure, are examples of what the future of cybersecurity looks like in a zero-trust world. Gaining AI and ML-based insights at machine speed, as CrowdStrike’s new AI-powered IOA does, is what enterprises need to stay secure while pivoting to new business opportunities in the future.

        "content": "Fallen High-Rollers Like a lot of other folks out there, the sullen owners of Miami nightclubs have lost out in the crypto crash — although not necessarily because they invested their savings into the cryptocurrencies. Instead, they're missing out on the business of high-rolling crypto millionaires, who according to club owners sought to loudly flaunt their newfound wealth on the city's world-renowned nightlife scene. \"Out of the blue, all these kids from crypto started coming down and spending a lot of money,\" Andrea Vimercati, director of food and beverage at Moxy Hotel group and former director of Groot Hospitality, told the Financial Times. Groot Hospitality operates Liv, Story, and Swan, three major Miami hotspots. \"Like, an insane amount of money.\" But as FT reports, the \"young,\" \"nerdy,\" and eager-to-spend crypto bros who not too long ago were hitting the clubs en masse — so much so that clubs like E11even even started to accept payment in crypto — are noticeably missing from the same hotspots they once swarmed. And considering that the current state of the cryptosphere, it's unclear whether they'll ever come back. Jordan Belfort Lite According to club operators, the wealth displayed by the crypto rich was genuinely extreme. Per the FT, the debauchery included bathtubs filled with champagne and handing rapper Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson III a \"bunch of cash\" to throw to club-goers during a performance. The tackiness even reportedly included clubgoers literally just showing people how much money they held in their crypto wallets. \"They wanted to show that they didn’t have any limits,\" Vimercati told the FT. \"They were ordering 12 or 24 bottles of the most expensive champagne and just showering themselves without even drinking.\" Indeed, if there was anywhere for these young entrepreneurs to attempt to live out their nerdy Jordan Belfort fantasy, Miami — with its flashy night scene, crypto-optimism and, at the time, low COVID restrictions — was the place. As the FT points out, the annual Bitcoin Conference even relocated to Miami from Los Angeles, and the Florida town's mayor even pushed for widespread crypto integration throughout the city. To that point, none of this is terribly surprising. The cryptosphere is a market that, especially at its peak, has always been driven by hype, promotion, and a \"get rich quick\" mentality, and few things might encompass all of those things more fully than publicly showering yourself with luxury champagne, without even stopping to drink it.

It has become quite hysterical and there's a kind of witch hunt and a lack of understanding.\" As for specific Hollywood A-listers who fell victim to such ostracization, Bonham Carter said Depp \"certainly went through it.\" Per Bonham Carter, Depp — who has worked with her in several films and is the godfather to her two children with former partner Tim Burton — has been \"completely vindicated\" following his six-week-long bombshell defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard . \"I think he's fine now,\" Bonham Carter added. \"Totally fine.\" Related Daniel Radcliffe is no Voldemort: \"Harry Potter\" actor assures that Rowling doesn't speak for him The Depp-Heard trial came to a dramatic end in June , after a seven-person jury determined that Heard had acted with \"malice\" in her 2018 op-ed published for The Washington Post . Per the jury, Heard's written accounts of domestic abuse were enough to qualify as defamation and subsequently tainted Depp's own career and reputation. Heard was ultimately awarded $2 million in compensatory damages for her counterclaim while Depp was awarded $10 million in compensatory damages and $350,000 in punitive damages.

Bonham Carter also criticized the ongoing controversy involving \"Harry Potter\" author J.K. Rowling and her string of transphobic remarks. Rowling has taken a TERF stance for years and came under fire for her inflammatory rhetoric in June 2020, when she called out a Devex op-ed for using the term \"people who menstruate\" instead of \"women.\" The author continued to voice her beliefs in blog posts and even a 3,500-word essay , asserting that transgender rights essentially threatens the women's rights movement.

        "content": "A new particle accelerator at Michigan State University is producing long-awaited results. It’s called the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, and it was completed in January 2022. Researchers have published the first results from the linear accelerator in the journal Physics Review Letters. Physicists sometimes describe isotopes as different flavours of the same element. An atom of any element always has the same number of protons in its nucleus, but the number of neutrons can vary. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Carbon, for example, always has 6 protons, and its atomic number is 6. But there are different isotopes of carbon, each with a different number of neutrons, varying from 2 to 16. There are only two long-lived and stable isotopes of carbon: carbon-12 (12C) and carbon-13 (13C). Neither one decays, while all other carbon isotopes do. Some carbon isotopes last only a few thousand years; others exist for only the briefest moments. It’s the same with isotopes of other elements. And whether an isotope lasts for trillions of years or a trillionth of a second, its existence plays a role in nature. Isotopes are essential in understanding many things in nature, including astrophysical objects like neutron stars and the nature and history of our Solar System. Scientists compare isotope ratios in different objects to see how they might be related. Scientists sometimes call the different ratios “fingerprints” because they fulfill a similar evidentiary role. For example, scientists measured the isotope fingerprints of Earth and compared them to Apollo lunar samples to understand how the Moon formed. Physicists have been studying and identifying isotopes for over a century. With the advent of more powerful particle accelerators, researchers have identified isotopes that exist only for nanoseconds. It takes extremely high energy levels to produce these elusive atoms and sophisticated detectors to measure them. This is where the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) comes into play. The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams is a linear accelerator shaped like a paper clip. The powerful accelerator propels atoms to speeds greater than 50% of the speed of light. Image Credit: FRIB/MSU. Only about 250 isotopes of all types of atoms exist naturally on Earth. But theory predicts the existence of 7,000 of them, and researchers have already found about 3,000. FRIB is designed to close the gap between those numbers. Calculations predict that the accelerator will find 80% of all theorized isotopes. When its work is completed, the Chart of the Nuclides will list about 6,000 isotopes. FRIB is made of three segments totalling 488 meters (1600 feet long), folded into a paper-clip shape. In the first stage, stable atoms of selected elements pass through a gas of electrons. The gas strips electrons from the atoms, leaving positively charged ions. FRIB sends stable atoms through a gas of electrons that strips electrons from the atoms, leaving positive ions. Image Credit: FRIB/MSU. Then FRIB accelerates the positive ions to about half of the speed of light before directing them into their target. As the stream of ions strikes the target, the collision makes the ions lose or gain protons and neutrons. That makes them unstable, producing thousands of rare isotopes, some of which last for only brief moments. Before they can decay, the isotopes pass through a series of magnets acting as separators. They filter out isotopes by momentum and electrical charge. What remains are the isotopes desired for a particular experiment, which reach FRIB’s suite of instruments that measure the nature of the particles. After colliding with the target, the rare and unstable isotopes pass through a series of magnets that filter out unwanted isotopes. Image Credit: FRIB/MSU. Researchers can’t direct FRIB to produce specific isotopes. It’s all based on probabilities. Scientists say that creating the rarest of isotopes in FRIB faces long odds: 1 in 1 quadrillion. But FRIB produces so many collisions and isotopes in a single run that 1 in 1 quadrillion isn’t insurmountable. The mass production of collisions and isotopes led to the prediction that the accelerator could produce 80% of all theorized isotopes. FRIB has already run two experiments. The first was run at only 25% of the accelerator’s full power. It created a beam of Calcium-48 and directed it into a beryllium target. This resulted in about 40 different isotopes reaching the detectors. By measuring the time of arrival, what isotope it was, and how long it took to decay, the experiment detected five new half-lives for exotic isotopes of phosphorus, silicon, aluminum, and magnesium. Measuring these half-lives provides insights into different models of the atomic realm. Researchers from multiple institutions took part in the first experiment. The lead spokesperson for the first experiment is Heather Crawford, a physicist at Berkeley Lab. A new paper in the Physical Review Letters presented the results. “This is a basic science question, but it links to the bigger picture for the field. Our aim is to describe not only these nuclei, but all kinds of nuclei. These models help us fill in the gaps, which helps us more reliably predict things we haven’t been able to measure yet.”Heather Crawford, Berkeley Lab staff scientist, Nuclear Science Division The second experiment was directed at understanding neutron stars. Neutron stars are stellar remnants, the collapsed cores of stars that exploded as supernovae. Neutron stars are made of extraordinarily dense matter and no longer undergo fusion. There’s still a lot going on in neutron stars, and there’s much theorizing about how they function. Scientists know that neutron stars contain rare isotopes of scandium, calcium and potassium. In this experiment, researchers produced a beam of selenium-28 to produce the same rare scandium, calcium, and potassium isotopes. This experiment began in June, and the results haven’t been published yet. But it shows how FRIB can address fundamental questions about some of nature’s most extreme objects. FRIB can address other questions, not all related to astrophysical objects. Some of its research should shed light on more practical concerns. In the past, research into nuclear science has produced results that have reduced suffering and shaped people’s lives. Medical imaging technologies like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) are the results of basic research into nuclear physics. So are smoke detectors, something so simple, effective, and inexpensive they can easily be taken for granted. It’s impossible to calculate how many lives smoke detectors have saved and how much tragedy they’ve prevented. Same with MRI and PET. Scientists are hopeful that research at FRIB can make similarly valuable contributions to society. History shows us that we can’t always predict the practical benefits of basic research like this but that civilization would look very different without it. When American physicist Isidor Isaac Rabi developed a way to measure sodium atoms’ movement and magnetic properties, he wasn’t thinking about imaging the insides of human bodies. But as his work and the work of other scientists continued, scientists understood that they could use these measurements and other advances to eventually detect cancer. This work led to the development of MRI, a commonplace medical technology in our world. (Rabi eventually won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of nuclear magnetic resonance.) Is it too much to hope that FRIB can somehow contribute to medical science? Not at all, though there are no specifics right now. But the history of one type of cancer treatment is another case study of how research into nuclear physics has reduced suffering. It’s called proton beam therapy. Proton beam therapy allows for higher doses of radiation to be given to children and sensitive tissues like livers, eyes, and optic nerves. It can target cancer cells more precisely and avoid damaging healthy cells. It stems directly from research at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory in the 1940s. In fact, the first proton beam therapy was given to patients with particle accelerators built for research, not medicine. Now proton beams are regularly used to remove eye tumours, among other things. Will FRIP eventually treat patients? No. That’s highly unlikely. But history shows that if we want to make advances that reduce suffering, facilities like FRIP can play a significant role. FRIP was built to learn about some of nature’s most fascinating objects, like neutron stars. Our understanding of physics is incomplete, and researchers at FRIP intend to fill in some of the blanks. The rest of us get to come along for the ride, and that’s a win for intellectually curious people everywhere. And if some of what we learn is applied to our everyday lives, that’s a win, too.

        "content": "In what's surely exciting news for some of you out there, scientists in China claim to have genetically modified an obscure plant to produce cocaine in its leaves. According to New Scientist, researchers have been trying to determine how the coca plant — the flora from which the drug cocaine is derived — produces the party-friendly compound for decades. It's a complex biochemical affair, and while researchers more recently have been able to map out most of the plants' process, one key element has continued to evaded them: how, exactly, a chemical precursor dubbed MPOA is converted into a section of the cocaine molecule. Excitingly, that missing link is exactly what the scientists, who hail from Kunming Institute of Botany in China, say they were able to unveil. As detailed in a new paper they published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, the researchers were able to identify two previously unknown enzymes — called EnCYP81AN15 and EnMT4 — in the cocaine production line. The scientists then gene hacked a Nicotiana benthamiana, a close relative of the tobacco plant, to grow the enzymes. And voilá: the tobacco plant yielded a measly-but-still-exciting 400 nanograms of cocaine per milligram of dried leaf, or roughly one 25th of the yield of an average coca plant. Before any of you out there get a little too excited, this innovation wasn't developed for recreational consumption. While it's most famous as a party drug, cocaine actually has some enduring medical uses. Ideally, this development not only sheds light on a biochemical mystery, but contributes to ensuring that the substance — an anesthetic that as recently as 2020 was cleared by the FDA for controlled use in a nasal spray — is available for pharmaceutical purposes. \"At present,\" Sheng-Xiong Huang, a leader on the study, told New Scientist, \"the available production of cocaine in tobacco is not enough to meet the demand on a mass scale.\" \"[This breakthrough] may allow pharmaceutical companies to ferment it, essentially, and so completely get rid of plant-based production,\" Benjamin Lichman, a researcher at the University of York who wasn't involved with the research, told New Scientist. Intriguingly, Lichman also allowed for the possibility that modifying plants to produce banned substances could become a factor in the drug trade. \"That will have huge impacts on supply chain and potentially impacts on, even, illicit production.\" For now, though, it's unlikely that cartel operations will seize on the tech, at least not for some time. This new gene hacking process isn't exactly cheap, and is nowhere near scalable — as of now, you'd be far better off sticking with the good ol' way of just harvesting cocaine from the coca plant. Regardless, it's interesting work — and could lay the groundwork for exciting biochemical and pharmaceutical study to follow.

This will be a tough task, but also a worthy national project,\" writes Ryan Hass. This piece originally appeared in the Taipei Times . There has been a surge of global interest in Taiwan’s security in recent years. Amidst the noise, it can be easy to lose sight of broader trends that are shaping the environment within which Taiwan operates. Taking a broader view can bring into focus what tasks are most important for Taiwan to protect its democratic way of life. Ryan Hass Senior Fellow - Foreign Policy , Center for East Asia Policy Studies , John L. Thornton China Center The Michael H. Armacost Chair Chen-Fu and Cecilia Yen Koo Chair in Taiwan Studies Nonresident Fellow, Paul Tsai China Center, Yale Law School Twitter ryanl_hass At the global level, several trends are unfolding in parallel. First, great power competition is intensifying. Russia is employing violence to seek to redraw boundaries. China is advancing its ambitions by operating below the threshold of conflict. China-Russia relations are unnaturally close by historical standards. Moscow’s and Beijing’s revisionist undertakings are attracting coordinated pushback from developed countries. Iran and North Korea also are contributing to rising geopolitical tensions. At the same time, transnational challenges are intensifying. The effects of climate change and global pandemics are roiling societies on every continent. The global economy appears headed toward recession. Emerging markets are facing rising debt distress. Russia’s use of food and fuel as strategic weapons is generating insecurities, particularly among the world’s most vulnerable populations. And geostrategic competition is hindering coordination to deliver solutions. European powers are dealing with the largest land war on their continent since World War II. They are working to limit destruction of war in Ukraine even as they cope with the costs of the conflict for their own people. Many Asian countries are searching for a strategically stable position between the United States and China. None wish to see China dominate the region and limit their freedom of maneuver. At the same time, none see profit in joining any type of anti-China containment coalition. Many Asian countries are relieved that the United States has returned to an active leadership role. At the same time, they are disenchanted by the meagerness of America’s economic agenda and unsure whether Washington will continue to lean forward in Asia after its next presidential election in 2024. Over the past two years, the United States has re-invested in alliances and in domestic initiatives to spur innovation. Over the next two years, America’s politics will become more charged; divided government and a presidential election could deepen partisan divisions. There is no appetite among the American electorate for bold projects to solve global problems. The public mood is more focused on addressing challenges at home. In other words, there is not ready enthusiasm in the United States or elsewhere for a military showdown with China over Taiwan. China also has its own reasons not to want to force a military test of wills in the Taiwan Strait. China’s leaders face mounting challenges, from zero-COVID lockdowns to high youth unemployment, a sagging property sector, mounting debt, worsening demographics, and a less permissive external environment for China’s rise. Related Books Stronger: Adapting America’s China Strategy in an Age of Competitive Interdependence By Ryan Hass 2021 Difficult Choices By Richard C. Bush 2021 Middle Class Shanghai By Cheng Li 2021 Against this backdrop, it is unsurprising that President Xi largely repeated boilerplate Chinese language on Taiwan in his work report to the 20th Party Congress. His reported instruction to the People’s Liberation Army to be prepared for military operations in the Taiwan Strait by 2027 is an acknowledgement that they are not yet prepared now. Xi also left President Biden with an impression that conflict is not imminent when both leaders met on the margins of the G-20. This is not to suggest that China’s appetite for absorbing Taiwan has diminished. To be sure, China will work to tilt cross-Strait dynamics in its preferred direction. Beijing will continue to invest aggressively in its nuclear arsenal as well as its conventional military capabilities. They will study Russia’s mistakes in Ukraine for lessons on vulnerabilities that they must remedy in their own force. They will seek to disrupt European Union unity on Taiwan policy to limit European involvement in cross-Strait issues. They also will employ threats and incentives to try to keep other countries such as South Korea, the Philippines, and India on the sidelines. Beijing will seek to strengthen self-reliance in key sectors to future-proof against anticipable Western economic sanctions. And they will attempt to limit Taiwan’s economic and political links with the rest of the world as part of a strategy to increase Taiwan’s dependence upon China for future growth. In other words, China is not standing still, even as it continues to operate below the threshold of military conflict. The key question, therefore, is whether Taiwan will use the coming years more effectively than China to strengthen its relative position. President Tsai has made commendable progress in seeking to strengthen Taiwan’s defense capabilities, enhance societal resilience, deepen connections with major powers, and diversify trade and investment flows. She and her successor will need to accelerate these efforts going forward. There is urgent work to bolster territorial defenses, strengthen Taiwan’s overall military deterrent, and improve Taiwan’s emergency preparedness through investments in stockpiles of munitions, food, medicine, and energy resources. Taiwan also can lower vulnerability by reducing dependencies on China’s market for key products, including upstream inputs for Taiwan’s semiconductor sector, medical supplies, and clean energy technologies. With clarity of vision and unity of purpose, Taiwan can put itself in a stronger position to protect its democratic way of life. This will be a tough task, but also a worthy national project.

        "description": "How the best Star Wars show yet undermines its otherwise powerful message with harmful stereotypes",
        "content": "-- Shares Facebook Twitter Reddit Email view in app The following contains spoilers from Season 1 of \"Andor\" on Disney+ While Star Wars may be set in a galaxy far, far away, it is and always has been an allegory for our world and its politics. 2016's \"Rogue One\" built on this by taking the mostly vague anti-authoritarianism of the prior films and bringing it down to earth . Suddenly we weren't watching a black-and-white struggle fought by elites with red and blue laser swords, but average people doing their best in terrible circumstances, in a world that looked an awful lot like our own. Disney's latest Star Wars television series, \"Andor\"—a \"Rogue One\" prequel that follows one of the movie's heroes, Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) — picks up this mantle, but swaps allusions to U.S. wars in the Middle East for the rise of fascism. When it's elaborating on the brutal consolidation of power under the Galactic Empire and the complicated struggle to overthrow it, \"Andor\" handles politics with more verve and nuance than any incarnation of Star Wars before it. However, the way that creator Tony Gilroy portrays one particular family made some viewers uneasy. Eedy Karn (Kathryn Hunter), a human woman on Coruscant, embodies several antisemitic stereotypes, which is troubling enough. But then her son Syril (Kyle Soller) is also striving to join and serve an Empire meant to evoke the Nazis. Combined, these two depictions not only dilute the impact of the historical parallels that the show works hard to draw but has political implications in the real-world — as any good allegory should — that must concern us. Related There's no hiding from it: The politics of \"Andor\" look a lot like the type troubling our world A civil servant and his mother (and Uncle Harlo) When we first meet Syril Karn, he's a deputy security inspector for an interplanetary corporation, Preox-Morlana — or the Pre-Mor Authority — to which the Galactic Empire has outsourced the governance of several planets. When Cassian kills two security guards in self-defense, Syril is ordered to \"conjure a suitable accident\" to cover up the embarrassing loss, but instead decides to investigate and then apprehend Cassian. The incursion quickly turns into a rout with two of Syril's men dead and nothing to show for it. \"Take solace in this,\" Syril is told after he's stripped of his rank. \"You will not be replaced . . . As of this morning, the Morlana system is under permanent Imperial authority.\" While Eedy and Syril are not Jewish — since, presumably, Judaism does not exist in the Star Wars galaxy — there are strong indications that they are coded as Jews. Unemployed, humiliated, his spirit broken, Syril turns to the one person from whom he might reasonably expect unconditional help: his mother. She greets him first with a slap across the face, then a tight and tearful hug. Eedy's emotional manipulativeness gets far worse from there. In an extended interaction between the two, Syril is hunched despondently over a bowl of cereal with blue milk, while Eedy demeans him: \"Is that how you've been presenting yourself to the world?\" she asks. \"It would explain a great deal. You might as well wear a sign that says, 'I promise to disappoint you.' Shame we couldn't have seen more of each other when you were flourishing. I'd have the memory to sustain me.\" Eedy then gets to her real point: \"My assumption is, you have no prospect for the future.\" Despite Syril's half-hearted assurances, she's unconvinced and exerts greater control, unilaterally deciding to, \"call in the family favor\" from a mysterious Uncle Harlo. In two minutes flat, Eedy hits all the major notes of the \" Jewish mother trope ,\" belittling, manipulating and aggressively meddling in her son's life. Invoking the name of the well-connected yet unseen Uncle Harlo at the tail end of a litany of Jewish mother stereotypes only raises the antisemitic specter of conspiratorial Jewish power – but it's a well that the show dips into again and again. On the morning of Syril's interview at the Bureau of Standards, secured by Uncle Harlo, Eedy questions Syril's apparently uncommon choice of suit. \"What makes you believe the Bureau of Standards is in the market for individuals?\" she says. \"Uncle Harlo's influence is not a thing to be trifled with. He's done us a tremendous favor. You need to remember you're not just representing yourself today.\" Syril Karn (Kyle Soller) and Flob (Alex Blake) in \"Andor\" (Disney+/Lucasfilm) At Syril's interview, we find out the extent of Uncle Harlo's influence. While giving a tour of the enormous bureaucratic complex, the interviewer sees \"Morlana One\" on his tablet and recognizes the disaster Syril presided over. But even as Syril rushes to offer a defense, the civil servant reassures him, \"Probably best for everyone to just edit this a bit before signing you in. I'm sure your uncle would approve.\" Not only has Uncle Harlo secured Syril the interview, but he's also made it possible to scrub that damning record. Is Syril's landing the job enough for his mother? Hardly. While she harangues him to eat since he's been so busy (as an office drone and with his own secret mission), he in turn accuses her of searching his room, invading his privacy. \"I find you a job, I press your uniform, I prepare two meals a day,\" she retorts. \"I move mountains to scrape you off the floor and put you back on your feet, and what do I reap? What is the return on my investment ? . . . The shadow of a son, a tenant, a stranger – all that time away on Morlana, imagine I'd cracked under the weight of your neglect. Imagine I'd cracked and wasn't here now to pick up the pieces.\" Guilt trip done, when she learns that he's been promoted, her demeanor once again turns loving. \"I knew they'd recognize your promise,\" she says before noting how pleased Uncle Harlo will be. Jewish coding, alongside Nazi depictions While Eedy and Syril are not Jewish — since, presumably, Judaism does not exist in the Star Wars galaxy — there are strong indications that they are coded as Jews. As a Jew myself, this coding is striking — Eedy's appearance, accent, intonation, mannerisms and phrasing, as well as the topics of conversation and the dynamic of her relationship with her son. And this would extend to Syril because if we read Eedy as Jewish, then he would be too as her son . All of this adds up to create a visceral impression in me, and I am not the only one to feel this way. Both the Jewish author Abraham Josephine Riesman , as well as the right-wing publication Bounding into Comics , share this appraisal of Eedy. While many of the elements of this coding would be fine on their own, their complete saturation of the character forms the context in which plot points like Uncle Harlo are able to take on a more sinister meaning. The Empire is ... crucially, subjects that go about their daily lives ignoring or enthusiastically supporting barbarity in the name of law and order, out of fear or simply for personal gain. This is not to say that characters can't seem, or explicitly be, Jewish while doing bad things and being bad people. No demographic group is exclusively good or bad, and this should be reflected in fiction. But, while I cannot speak to the intention of the show writers, piling antisemitic trope upon trope — narcissism, manipulativeness, shadowy influence and a greedy view of the world — can only cause harm. This harm is reinforced both by the story the show is telling about fascism, as well as the context in which it is being watched and absorbed. Supervisor Dedra Meero (Denise Gough) and Bix Caleen (Adria Arjona) in \"Andor\" (Disney+/Lucasfilm) Star Wars has always drawn inspiration from the Nazis, but never has this had greater depth than in \"Andor,\" nor more weight than in our own time of rising fascism. Coruscant, the capital of the Empire and setting for the resistance intrigues of Mon Mothma (Genevieve O'Reilly) and Luthen Rael (Stellan Skarsgaard), has a retrofuture, art-deco aesthetic — from the clothing and hair to the architecture and interior design to the flying cars — suggesting a parallel with Nazi-era Berlin. Beyond aesthetics, the genocidal aspect of the Empire is developed in greater detail, as well. Not yet vaporizing entire planets from afar, the Empire exterminates methodically and in close quarters — in one instance, recording the death lamentations of a species it was eradicating, and then using these sounds to torture political dissidents like Bix Caleen (Adria Arjona). \"Andor\" demonstrates, however, that the Empire is far from a hivemind. It's a political and military organization with layers of bureaucracy, divergences of opinion, internal rivalries and, crucially, subjects that go about their daily lives ignoring or enthusiastically supporting barbarity in the name of law and order, out of fear or simply for personal gain. Eedy and Syril are two such subjects. Syril is obsessed with the Empire, taking every opportunity he can to find a role to play within it, even resorting to stalking the exceptionally cruel Imperial Security Bureau (ISB) supervisor Dedra Meero (Denise Gough). While Eedy is less overtly enthusiastic, she's still clearly a supporter of repression. As a news report about the rebel attack on Aldhani plays in the background, Eedy summarizes it as, \"Rabble. They attacked a garrison. They'll regret it.\" Eedy and Syril are thus not just coded as Jews, but as Jews supporting a genocidal regime that is Nazi in nearly every way but name.

The positive feelings I have for \"Andor\" come with a giant asterisk. \"Andor\" is a genuinely exciting reinterpretation and deepening of the Star Wars universe and, to its credit, it uses the tremendous clout of the franchise to draw attention to essential issues. The show illustrates that fascism isn't just imposed, but requires a broad base of support: it needs true believers and opportunists; it needs those who prefer it to the alternative and those who will tolerate it so long as it does not harm them personally; and, perhaps most importantly, it needs the largest number to feel too afraid and powerless to stand up for themselves, and one another, before it is too late. This could hardly be a more important lesson as we head into our own growing struggle against fascism. Kloris (Lee Ross) and Mon Mothma (Genevieve O'Reilly) in \"Andor\" (Disney+/Lucasfilm) But the positive feelings I have for \"Andor\" come with a giant asterisk. The show's repeated use of Jewish stereotypes, which range from relatively benign to unequivocally antisemitic – in a time of increasingly uninhibited advocacy of the most virulent antisemitic conspiracy theories, and sharply increasing hate crimes against Jews – is genuinely harmful. What the depiction of Eedy and Syril Karn may lack in overt anti-Jewish animosity, it makes up for by delivering a more subtle and difficult-to-challenge antisemitism – an antisemitism that worms its way into basic assumptions, contributing to a swelling tide upon which hatred and violence are able to crest higher and higher. Fascism needs targets, and Jews sit among the perennial favorites. In a time of a nearly ubiquitous fascist resurgence, in a show that makes fascism its thematic centerpiece, the inclusion of timeworn antisemitic tropes is, at best, a grave oversight, but it is one that we cannot overlook.

        "content": "Domino Effect Yet another major cryptocurrency lender has filed for bankruptcy, a sign of a deepening \"crypto winter\" that's continuing to take down the hype giants one by one. Crypto lender BlockFi is filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection just weeks after FTX, once the second largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, imploded in spectacular fashion, sending ripples throughout the industry. BlockFi, which promised to act as a bridge between the crypto and the more traditional financial world, says the filing will allow it to stabilize operations and restructure. We'll have to see. Significant Exposure At the time FTX went under in a major destabilizing event that wiped out a $32 billion valuation in a matter of days, BlockFi had already announced it was pausing withdrawals, which spread rumors of an impending bankruptcy filing. In fact, FTX's collapse had direct repercussions on BlockFi's business. \"We do have significant exposure to FTX and associated corporate entities that encompasses obligations owed to us by Alameda, assets held at FTX.com, and undrawn amounts from our credit line with FTX.US,\" BlockFi said in a statement a week after FTX collapsed. Reimbursement The company now has a lot to answer for. According to the Associated Press, the company has more than 100,000 creditors and is liable for anywhere between $1 billion and $10 billion. At one point, the company was valued at $4.8 billion. As of right now, BlockFi has just $257 million in cash — meagre crumbs that it hopes will be enough to turn its operations around start picking up the pieces.

My bedside table pic.twitter.com/sIdRYJcLTK — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 28, 2022 Drama Queen As always, we have no idea why Musk posted the image, outside of drumming up drama — Musk's provocative way of entertaining himself — and discussions about the Second Amendment. But we know one thing for sure: that bedside table is filthy. The man is in desperate need of some coasters, or at least a wet wipe, judging by the stains covering every surface. \"There's no excuse for my lack of coasters,\" Musk admitted in a follow up. Gun Club Readers were quick to connect the image to Musk's pro-gun rhetoric. \"I strongly believe that the right to bear arms is an important safeguard against potential tyranny of government,\" Musk told CNBC back in May. \"Historically, maintaining their power over the people is why those in power did not allow public ownership of guns.\" Musk, who moved to Texas last year and has recently announced he was planning to vote Republican, did dial down his view on the matter, adding that he supports \"tight background checks\" for all gun sales and that the sale of assault weapons should be limited. The only problem? The modern gun in the pic is fake, and if the historical pistol is functional, it wouldn't be very practical. There's also a question of taste; the post follows a horrific string of mass shootings that have reignited a fierce debate surrounding gun control. As usual with Musk, though, controversy seems to be the goal.

(credit: Mia Shi/University of Waterloo) Scientists at the University of Waterloo have determined the optimal design for a splash-free urinal: a tall, slender porcelain structure with curves reminiscent of a nautilus shell, playfully dubbed the \"Nauti-loo.\" That's good news for men tired of having urine splash onto their pants and shoes—and for the poor souls who have to regularly clean up all the splatter. Bonus: It's quite an aesthetically appealing design, giving this workhorse of the public restroom a touch of class. “The idea originated exactly where you think it did,” Waterloo's Zhao Pan told New Scientist. “I think most of us have been a little inattentive at our post and looked down to find we were wearing speckled pants. Nobody likes having pee everywhere, so why not just create a urinal where splatter is extremely unlikely?” His graduate student, Kaveeshan Thurairajah, presented the results of this research during last week's American Physical Society (APS) meeting on fluid dynamics in Indianapolis. It's not the first time scientists have attempted to address this issue. Pan is a former graduate student of Tadd Truscott, a mechanical engineer who founded the so-called \"Splash Lab\" at Utah State University. In 2013, the Splash Lab (then at Brigham Young University) offered a few handy tips on how men could avoid staining their khaki pants with urine splashback while relieving themselves in restrooms. \"Sitting on the toilet is the best technique, since there’s less distance for the pee to cover on its journey to the bowl,\" I wrote previously at Gizmodo. \"If you opt for the classic standing technique, the scientists advised standing as close to the urinal as possible, and trying to direct the stream at a downward angle toward the back of the urinal.\"Read 6 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "content": "HONOLULU (AP) — Hawaii’s Mauna Loa, the world’s largest active volcano , began spewing ash and debris from its summit, prompting civil defense officials to warn residents on Monday to prepare in case the eruption causes lava to flow toward communities. The eruption began late Sunday night in the summit caldera of the volcano on the Big Island following a series of closely spaced, fairly large earthquakes, Ken Hon, the scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcanos Observatory, said at an early morning news conference. Magma moved to the surface, although lava flows were contained within the summit area and weren’t threatening nearby communities. Advertisement A time-lapse video of the eruption from overnight shows molten lava lighting up the caldera, moving across it like waves on the ocean. There have been some photos provided to the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory that suggest that the south end of the caldera has overflowed, causing some lava flows a few kilometers (miles) out of the caldera, Hon said. In some previous eruptions, lava has overflowed the caldera but never made it close to populated areas. “Right now we are looking at indications, trying to figure out if this is going to be an eruption that remains within the summit of Mauna Loa or moves down one of the rift zones either to the southwest and to the northeast,” Hon said. Advertisement “We don’t want to try and second guess the volcano,” Hon said. “We have to let it actually show us what it’s going to do and then we inform people of what is happening ASAP.” There is currently no indication of any migration of the eruption into a rift zone, officials said. A rift zone is where the mountain is splitting apart and the rock is cracked and relatively weak - making it easier for magma to emerge. The ground is shaking and swelling at Mauna Loa, the largest active volcano in the world, indicating that it could erupt. Scientists say they don't expect that to happen right away but officials on the Big Island of Hawaii are telling residents to be prepared in case it does erupt soon. This map shows the lava flow hazard level zones for the island. via Associated Press “At this time, it’s not a time to be alarmed,” Big Island Mayor Mitch Roth said. There are no evacuation orders. Even though it noted there is no indication of lava moving into a rift one, Hawaii County Civil Defense announced it has opened shelters in Kailua-Kona and Pahala because it has reports of people self-evacuating along the South Kona coast. Scientists will have to wait to see if this remains a summit-only eruption or a rift zone eruption. The average Mauna Loa eruption is not typically prolonged, lasting a couple of weeks, Hon said. Advertisement “Typically, Mauna Loa eruptions start off with the heaviest volume first,” Hon said. “After a few days, it starts to calm down a little bit.” The USGS warned residents at risk from Mauna Loa lava flows should review their eruption preparations. Scientists had been on alert because of a recent spike in earthquakes at the summit of the volcano, which last erupted in 1984. Portions of the Big Island were under an ashfall advisory issued by the National Weather Service in Honolulu, which said up to a quarter-inch (0.6 centimeters) of ash could accumulate in some areas. Mauna Loa is one of five volcanoes that together make up the Big Island of Hawaii, which is the southernmost island in the Hawaiian archipelago. Mauna Loa, rising 13,679 feet (4,169 meters) above sea level, is the much larger neighbor to Kilauea volcano, which erupted in a residential neighborhood and destroyed 700 homes in 2018. Some of its slopes are much steeper than Kilauea’s - so when it erupts, lava can flow much faster. Advertisement During a 1950 eruption, the mountain’s lava traveled 15 miles (24 kilometers) to the ocean in less than three hours. Tourism is the economic engine for Hawaii, but Roth predicted few problems for those on vacation during the eruption. “If it does go into one of the rift zones, it’s going to impact a very small area of the island,” he said. “It will be spectacular where it is, but the chances of it really interrupting the visitor industry — very, very slim.” For some, the eruption might cut down on some travel time, even if there is more vog, or volcanic smog caused by higher sulfur dioxide emissions. “But the good thing is you don’t have to drive from Kona over to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park to see an eruption anymore,” Roth said. “You can just look out your window at night and you’ll be able to see Mauna Loa erupting.” Advertisement ___ Associated Press writer Mark Thiessen in Anchorage, Alaska, contributed to this report.

Over the holiday weekend, the great minds behind the Elon Goat Token — an in-your-face homage to the man they consider to be the \"Greatest of All Time,\" or GOAT — decided to unleash upon the streets of Austin, Texas their metallic Frankenstein's monster: a bizarre behemoth that's supposedly the face of Musk on a goat's body, but that looks a lot more like if the owner of Tesla, SpaceX, and Twitter was grafted onto Dune's infamous shai hulud sandworms.

Indeed, the price of the already-low-value coin has plummeted dramatically since November 26, which was the day the coin's makers held their \"#GOATsgiving\" unveiling and drive-by of the statue. As of right now, the Elon Goat Token is worth a very small fraction of a cent, though again, it wasn't worth all that much more at its Thanksgiving Day high, which totaled about $0.002 per coin. The whereabouts of the strange statue haven't been reported since Saturday, when it was \"delivered\" to Tesla's Austin Gigafactory.

Melendrez said the arrays can adjust their position relative to the rest of the spacecraft, which will optimize the collection of sunlight converted into electricity to power Orion. This also allows flight controllers in the Mission Control Center at NASA Johnson to point the cameras at different parts of the spacecraft for inspections and to document its surroundings in space, including the Earth and Moon. On Saturday Nov. 26, NASA said the Orion spacecraft broke the record for the farthest distance traveled from Earth of a human-rated spacecraft. The record was previously held by Apollo 13 at 248,655 statute miles from Earth. Earth and Moon close together prior to the eclipse, as seen from the Orion capsule. Credit: NASA livestream. However, that doesn’t take into account the Apollo 10 lunar module, nicknamed Snoopy (the Command Module was Charlie Brown), which might be still traveling in space. After carrying out a successful lunar orbit and docking procedure, Snoopy was jettisoned and sent into an orbit around the Sun. After 53 years, it’s believed to still be in a heliocentric orbit. A team of UK and international astronomers have been working to try and find it, but so far they haven’t had any luck. The Apollo 10 lunar module about to dock with the command module in 1969. Image Credit: NASA Meanwhile, Orion continues on its uncrewed mission, a shakeout flight to test the spacecraft and ground systems. It launched on the Space Launch System rocket on November 16, and is the first mission in 50 years where a human capable spacecraft is at the Moon. Orion is slated to return to Earth about 25 days after launch, with splashdown currently set for December 11. Using the same exterior cameras as the ones giving us these stunning views today, engineers have been able to assess the exterior or Orion and have deemed it to be in great shape.

(credit: NASA) The Atlantic hurricane season officially ends on Wednesday, bringing to a close the six-month period when the vast majority of tropical activity occurs in the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea. Prior to the season, forecasters generally expected a busier-than-normal season. However, six months later, overall activity this year has come in slightly below normal. One of the more scientifically rigorous measurements of seasonal activity—based on the length and intensity of storms—is accumulated cyclone energy. This year's value, 95, is about three-quarters of the normal value of 126. That bland statistic belies the fact that this was an odd season. After three weak early-season storms, the Atlantic basin produced zero named storms between July 3 and August 31. This was the first time since 1941 that the Atlantic had no named storm activity during this period. Then, a light came on. Four hurricanes formed in September, along with three more in November. This brought seasonal activity to near-normal levels.Read 11 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

Amateur (but expert!) image editor Judy Schmidt took the raw data from JWST’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and teased out this eerie, spider-web-like view of this distant galaxy. The swirling and symmetrical arms are so full of dust that not many stars are visible. The reddish areas correspond with star formation, however, Schmidt explained, which shows how the physics of star formation is intertwined with the amount of dust and gas in a galaxy. Additionally, the small central nucleus of NGC 1566 is extremely bright, which is a telltale sign of it being among the Seyfert class of galaxies. The centers of these galaxies are very active and luminous, emitting strong bursts of radiation and potentially harboring supermassive black holes that could be many millions of times the mass of the Sun. NGC 1566 is located approximately 40 million light-years away in the constellation of Dorado. This is an intermediate spiral galaxy, which means its shape is somewhere between a barred spiral galaxy (like our Milky Way) and a regular spiral galaxy. Happy Friday, everyone. Here's a new view from JWST's MIRI of spiral galaxy NGC 1566. The colors in this image come from the emission of dust. Hardly any stars are visible.

(AP Photo/Ariel Schalit) JERUSALEM, Israel – Before the FIFA World Cup soccer championships began in Qatar 10 days ago, Israelis were optimistic that the event could break cultural barriers in sports and within the Muslim world at large. After all, the government in Doha allowed direct flights from Israel and was even setting up a Kosher kitchen to accommodate Jewish tourists. Qatar is the first Muslim country to host the world cup, and although protests against the Gulf nation's funding of terrorism and other issues were prevalent before the games. Kan , Israel's public broadcaster, built an entire studio to cover the matches in Doha despite the Israel team's failure to qualify for the final 32 teams. In the afterglow of the Abraham Accords and given Israel's passion for soccer, it seemed like a solid decision. Since then, the talk of Kosher kitchens has given way to darker accounts. The Associated Press describes an incident before the matches began when an Israeli Kan journalist was wandering through the venue and found a Qatari man in a traditional headdress and white robe, and approached him for an interview: \"Which channel?\" the Qatari asked. The journalist replied he was from Kan, Israel's public broadcaster. The Qatari was stunned. “Where?” “Israel,\" the journalist repeated. A split-second later, the interview was over. The Jerusalem Post published accounts of other incidents in which a Saudi fan shouted at Kan's Foreign Affairs correspondent Moav Vardy, telling him, “You are not welcome here. This is Qatar.

        "content": "Deep 'blue holes,' like this one off Belize, can collect evidence of hurricanes. The TerraMar Project, CC BYIf you look back at the history of Atlantic hurricanes since the late 1800s, it might seem hurricane frequency is on the rise. The year 2020 had the most tropical cyclones in the Atlantic, with 31, and 2021 had the third-highest, after 2005. The past decade saw five of the six most destructive Atlantic hurricanes in modern history. Then a year like 2022 comes along, with no major hurricane landfalls until Fiona and Ian struck in late September. The Atlantic hurricane season, which ends Nov. 30, has had eight hurricanes and 14 named storms. It’s a reminder that small sample sizes can be misleading when assessing trends in hurricane behavior. There is so much natural variability in hurricane behavior year to year and even decade to decade that we need to look much further back in time for the real trends to come clear. Fortunately, hurricanes leave behind telltale evidence that goes back millennia. Two thousand years of this evidence indicates that the Atlantic has experienced even stormier periods in the past than we’ve seen in recent years. That’s not good news. It tells coastal oceanographers like me that we may be significantly underestimating the threat hurricanes pose to Caribbean islands and the North American coast in the future. The natural records hurricanes leave behind When a hurricane nears land, its winds whip up powerful waves and currents that can sweep coarse sands and gravel into marshes and deep coastal ponds, sinkholes and lagoons. Under normal conditions, fine sand and organic matter like leaves and seeds fall into these areas and settle to the bottom. So when coarse sand and gravel wash in, a distinct layer is left behind. Imagine cutting through a layer cake – you can see each layer of frosting. Scientists can see the same effect by plunging a long tube into the bottom of these coastal marshes and ponds and pulling up several meters of sediment in what’s known as a sediment core. By studying the layers in sediment, we can see when coarse sand appeared, suggesting an extreme coastal flood from a hurricane. With these sediment cores, we have been able to document evidence of Atlantic hurricane activity over thousands of years. The red dots indicate large sand deposits going back about 1,060 years. The yellow dots are estimated dates from radiocarbon dating of small shells. Tyler Winkler We now have dozens of chronologies of hurricane activity at different locations – including New England, the Florida Gulf Coast, the Florida Keys and Belize – that reveal decade- to century-scale patterns in hurricane frequency. Others, including from Atlantic Canada, North Carolina, northwestern Florida, Mississippi and Puerto Rico, are lower-resolution, meaning it is nearly impossible to discern individual hurricane layers deposited within decades of one another. But they can be highly informative for determining the timing of the most intense hurricanes, which can have significant impacts on coastal ecosystems. It’s the records from the Bahamas, however, with nearly annual resolution, that are crucial for seeing the long-term picture for the Atlantic Basin. Why The Bahamas are so important The Bahamas are exceptionally vulnerable to the impacts of major hurricanes because of their geographic location. In the North Atlantic, 85% of all major hurricanes form in what is known as the Main Development Region, off western Africa. Looking just at observed hurricane tracks from the past 170 years, my analysis shows that about 86% of major hurricanes that affect the Bahamas also form in that region, suggesting the frequency variability in the Bahamas may be representative of the basin. Atlantic hurricane tracks from 1851 to 2012. Nilfanion/Wikimedia A substantial percentage of North Atlantic storms also pass over or near these islands, so these records appear to reflect changes in overall North Atlantic hurricane frequency through time. By coupling coastal sediment records from the Bahamas with records from sites farther north, we can explore how changes in ocean surface temperatures, ocean currents, global-scale wind patterns and atmospheric pressure gradients affect regional hurricane frequency. As sea surface temperatures rise, warmer water provides more energy that can fuel more powerful and destructive hurricanes. However, the frequency of hurricanes – how often they form – isn’t necessarily affected in the same way. Hurricane Dorian sat over the Bahamas as a powerful Category 5 storm in 2019. Laura Dauphin/NASA Earth Observatory The secrets hidden in blue holes Some of the best locations for studying past hurricane activity are large, near-shore sinkholes known as blue holes. Blue holes get their name from their deep blue color. They formed when carbonate rock dissolved to form underwater caves. Eventually, the ceilings collapsed, leaving behind sinkholes. The Bahamas has thousands of blue holes, some as wide as a third of a mile and as deep as a 60-story building. They tend to have deep vertical walls that can trap sediments – including sand transported by strong hurricanes. Fortuitously, deep blue holes often have little oxygen at the bottom, which slows decay, helping to preserve organic matter in the sediment through time. Hine’s Blue Hole in the Bahamas is about 330 feet (100 meters) deep. Seismic imaging shows about 200 feet (60-plus meters) of accumulated sediment. Pete van Hengstum; Tyler Winkler Cracking open a sediment core When we bring up a sediment core, the coarse sand layers are often evident to the naked eye. But closer examination can tell us much more about these hurricanes of the past. I use X-rays to measure changes in the density of sediment, X-ray fluorescence to examine elemental changes that can reveal if sediment came from land or sea, and sediment textural analysis that examines the grain size. To figure out the age of each layer, we typically use radiocarbon dating. By measuring the amount of carbon-14, a radioactive isotope, in shells or other organic material found at various points in the core, I can create a statistical model that predicts the age of sediments throughout the core. So far, my colleagues and I have published five paleohurricane records with nearly annual detail from blue holes on islands across the Bahamas. Each record shows periods of significant increase in storm frequency lasting decades and sometimes centuries. The red dots show the sites of high-resolution paleohurricane records. The map shows the frequency of hurricanes ranked Category 2 or above from 1850 to 2019. Tyler Winkler The records vary, showing that a single location might not reflect broader regional trends. For example, Thatchpoint Blue Hole on Great Abaco Island in the northern Bahamas includes evidence of at least 13 hurricanes per century that were Category 2 or above between the years 1500 and 1670. That significantly exceeds the rate of nine per century documented since 1850. During the same period, 1500 to 1670, blue holes at Andros Island, just 186 miles (300 kilometers) south of Abaco, documented the lowest levels of local hurricane activity observed in this region during the past 1,500 years. Spotting patterns across the Atlantic Basin Together, however, these records offer a glimpse of broad regional patterns. They’re also giving us new insight into the ways ocean and atmospheric changes can influence hurricane frequency. While rising sea surface temperatures provide more energy that can fuel more powerful and destructive hurricanes, their frequency – how often they form – isn’t necessarily affected in the same way. Some studies have predicted the total number of hurricanes will actually decrease in the future. Comparing paleohurricane records from several locations shows periods of higher frequency. The highlighted periods cover the Little Ice Age, a time of cooler conditions in the North Atlantic from 1300 to 1850, and the Medieval Warm Period, from 900 to 1250. Tyler Winkler The compiled Bahamian records document substantially higher hurricane frequency in the northern Caribbean during the Little Ice Age, around 1300 to 1850, than in the past 100 years. That was a time when North Atlantic surface ocean temperatures were generally cooler than they are today. But it also coincided with an intensified West African monsoon. The monsoon could have produced more thunderstorms off the western coast of Africa, which act as low-pressure seeds for hurricanes. Steering winds and vertical wind shear likely also affect a region’s hurricane frequency over time. The Little Ice Age active interval observed in most Bahamian records coincides with increased hurricane strikes along the U.S. Eastern Seaboard from 1500 to 1670, but at the same time it was a quieter period in the Gulf of Mexico, central Bahamas and southern Caribbean. Records from sites farther north tell us more about the climate. That’s because changes in ocean temperature and climate conditions are likely far more important to controlling regional impacts in such areas as the Northeastern U.S. and Atlantic Canada, where cooler climate conditions are often unfavorable for storms. A warning for the islands I am currently developing records of coastal storminess in locations including Newfoundland and Mexico. With those records, we can better anticipate the impacts of future climate change on storm activity and coastal flooding. In the Bahamas, meanwhile, sea level rise is putting the islands at increasing risk, so even weaker hurricanes can produce damaging flooding. Given that storms are expected to be more intense, any increase in storm frequency could have devastating impacts.

Zimbabwe, with a population of 15 million, has only 19 psychiatrists. And in Uganda, there are 47 psychiatrists serving a country of 48 million — less than one single psychiatrist for every million people. These are staggering ratios. To get your head around them, take the US as a comparison. There are around 45,000 psychiatrists for all 333 million Americans, which translates to about 135 psychiatrists for every million people. That’s still not enough — experts are actually warning of an escalating shortage — and yet it’s a whopping 135 times more coverage than exists in Uganda. These numbers have very real, and sometimes very brutal, implications for people’s lives. When psychiatry and other forms of professional mental health care are not accessible, people suffer in silence or turn to whatever options they can find. In Ghana, for instance, thousands of desperate families bring their ailing loved ones to “prayer camps” in hopes of healing, only to find that the self-styled prophets there chain their loved ones to trees. Instead of receiving medical treatment for, say, schizophrenia, the patients receive prayers. The scandal of mental health care in developing countries has been well documented , and surveying it, you could be forgiven for thinking the solution is straightforward: These countries just need to train more psychiatrists and mental health professionals of the type you’d find in the US. But that’s too simplistic. Yes, training more mental health specialists will be part of the answer for these nations. But what’s most interesting is that developing countries have also figured out a new way to tackle the deficit in mental health care — and it could hold lessons for the developed world as well. Specifically, these nations have been serving as a proving ground for a model called community-based care, where non-specialist providers or lightly trained laypeople — picture someone like your grandmother, not a doctor — deliver brief mental health interventions in informal settings like homes or parks. Whereas importing Western norms can alienate local populations, who may not view mental health problems as medical, brain-based problems, community-based care has found acceptance because it pays attention to cultural context. Lay counsellors meet patients where they are — both literally, in terms of physical space, and conceptually, in terms of their beliefs about mental health. This model has turned out to be not only cheap to operate and easy to scale, but also incredibly effective for treating issues like depression. So effective, in fact, that the model is now being exported to the US, which stands to learn a lot from these poorer countries. Dixon Chipanda, psychiatrist and founder of the NGO Friendship Bench, visits with his grandmother. He says she was part of his inspiration for the benches project. Brent Stirton/Getty Images In 19th-century Europe, the reigning paradigm of mental health care was the asylum . The belief was that people suffering from psychiatric conditions should be institutionalized and treated on an inpatient basis. As Europeans exported this belief to the territories they colonized, asylums sprang up everywhere, from Ghana to India. By the middle of the 20th century, asylums were becoming discredited: They were too often sites of coercion and violence, not to mention notoriously overcrowded and unhygienic. At the same time, the discovery of new psychiatric medications fostered hope that patients could be treated on an outpatient basis. In Europe, many asylums shut down. But in the colonies, they didn’t . In Accra, the capital city of Ghana, a psychiatric hospital built on this model in 1904 still houses hundreds of patients, some voluntary and some involuntary. Their issues range from depression to psychosis. It’s a resource-strapped, overcrowded institution. When I visited the hospital in 2019 , I found that some patients sleep outdoors in a courtyard, where a motley collection of beds draped in mosquito nets was scattered around. The few who train in psychiatry tend to move to richer nations Thinking about the legacy of colonialism helps explain why this warehousing of the mentally ill persists, explained Vikram Patel, a psychiatrist and a professor of global health at Harvard Medical School. “When the Europeans left Africa, Asia, and Latin America, they left virtually no higher education infrastructure for the native people. Basically, the colonizers left nothing,” he said. Upon gaining independence, some postcolonial countries had just one medical school for the whole nation. “And if psychiatrists can only be trained in medical schools, well, then, you know. There’s nothing.” The very limited training capacity — and very limited funding to increase that capacity — has led to a supply-side problem. Today, that problem is aggravated by a major brain drain : The few who do train in psychiatry tend to move to richer nations offering them a more comfortable life. And most would-be doctors in Africa don’t want to specialize in psychiatry. For some, that’s because it’s associated with institutionalization or incarceration. Others, aware that their cultures stigmatize mental illness as the work of evil spirits, may fear being viewed as “tainted” by contact with mentally ill people. And this stigma creeps all the way up to the policymakers debating how to allocate scarce resources. “We bring these stigmas into the boardrooms and into decisions we make around fiscal planning,” Tina Ntulo, who leads the mental health nonprofit StrongMinds in Uganda, told me. “You do not budget for a person who you think is cursed or bewitched.” Many would-be patients are also hesitant to see psychiatrists, who represent a foreign idea. “People just don’t conceive of their mental health problem as a biomedical problem,” Patel said. “They do not say ‘I feel the way I do because I have an illness in the brain.’ That is exquisitely uncommon.” And in cultures that don’t view mental health problems through a medical lens, stigma is a major barrier to seeking out professional care. In one large-scale survey in Nigeria, for example, 83 percent of respondents said they would be afraid to even have a conversation with someone with a mental health problem. The social costs of being branded as mentally unwell are just too high. This is part of why some developing countries are moving toward community-based care. When you receive care from someone who’s familiar and helps you without necessarily applying a diagnostic label, it can mean there’s less stigma. Despite being a psychiatrist himself, Patel does not believe the answer to the mental health care deficit is to just train more doctors like him. Instead, he’s become one of the most influential advocates for community-based care, where people with just a bit of training — weeks or months, not years — offer focused therapy. Empowering non-specialist providers or laypeople to take on tasks formerly done by specialists is what the World Health Organization refers to as “task-shifting” or “task-sharing.” You might think that therapy delivered by a layperson is fine for countries that can’t afford more mental health professionals, but certainly not the ideal. Yet Patel and others who embrace the community-based model are making a much more radical claim. “A lot of people think this is just a stopgap arrangement. It’s not,” Patel told me. “In the US itself, you need community health workers. What we need in all countries is the same model. We need to have an army of community-based health workers, nurses, social workers, delivering evidence-based interventions.” And they are, in fact, evidence-based. Over the past two decades, dozens of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and other studies have come out in favor of the community-based model. Friendship Bench has already served more than 158,000 people Friendship Bench offers a prime example of what community-based care can look like. Rather than expecting people who are mentally unwell to seek out a psychiatrist’s office, this Zimbabwean nonprofit recruits “grandmothers” — middle-aged or older women who help out in their communities — to learn enough about depression and anxiety to recognize them, and then to treat those disorders using problem-solving therapy. That’s exactly what it sounds like: a therapy that teaches people the skills to devise their own solutions to the problems they face. Each grandmother, recognizable in her uniform, will then go sit on a bench in a yard. People come along, wanting to talk. In fact, since Friendship Bench was created in 2006, more than 1,600 grandmothers have been trained, and they’ve already served more than 158,000 people — to great effect. Friendship Bench counsellors attend a Sunday service at the Catholic church in Msvingo, Zimbabwe. The NGO offers free mental health counselling through trained grandmothers who work as lay health workers in clinics. Brent Stirton/Getty Images In a 2016 study , 573 patients were assigned to either a Friendship Bench or to a bolstered version of standard psychiatric care available in Zimbabwe, which includes antidepressants. Six months later, only 14 percent of those who’d sat with a grandmother were still depressed, compared to 50 percent of those in the standard care group. Another great example can be found in Uganda and Zambia: StrongMinds , a nonprofit founded in 2013, trains laypeople to lead group talk therapy sessions as a way to treat women with depression. Over a 12-week period, the women learn to identify the triggers of their depression and devise strategies to overcome them, using a form of therapy called group interpersonal therapy. “This therapy is culturally appropriate. It sees interpersonal relationships as the treatment for depression,” said Tina Ntulo, the country director for Uganda. “And on this continent we are still highly relational and dependent on each other.” Six months later, only 14 percent of those who’d sat with a grandmother were still depressed Working with laypeople has enabled StrongMinds to scale up quickly, reaching more than 160,000 women to date. “One of the amazing things our staff found is that the village volunteers [who’ve been trained to deliver the therapy] are so much better at mobilizing the women to come for therapy,” Ntulo told me. “Our staff said they never saw such high attendance for therapy when they were running it.” Two RCTs have demonstrated that this intervention is both powerful and cost-effective. Independent researchers estimate that StrongMinds prevents the equivalent of one year of severe major depressive disorder for a woman at a cost of $248 — a pretty good deal, especially when you consider this helps the woman as well as her dependents. Such interventions have spillover effects. The researchers note that mental health care can lead to material benefits: A non-depressed woman is more likely to be able to work, earn income, and get her kids to school so they can one day work and earn income, too. A third example of community-based care can be found in India, where Patel co-founded an organization called Sangath . It developed a six-session program in which lay counselors treat patients with severe depression. The program showed strong results , leading to significantly lower symptom severity and higher remission than in a control group after three months. But what’s really amazing about it is that, a full five years after researchers conducted the initial trial in India, a followup still showed significant differences between those who had received the treatment and a control group. The benefits, it turned out, could really last. Right about now, you may be thinking: This laypeople stuff sounds all well and good for people dealing with common mental disorders like depression or anxiety, especially if they’ve got mild cases, but some people need an actual psychiatrist. Even ardent proponents of community-based care agree with that. “You need some psychiatrists. There’s no question that they play a role,” Patel said. That can be true even when it comes to the common mental disorders: After all, though Sangath’s community-based program for treating depression in India showed strong results, about a third of participants remained depressed after the program. So the claim is not that community-based care should replace psychiatry. It’s that making mental health care primarily the business of psychiatrists, with little room for alternative approaches depending on context, is a mistake. Of course, achieving the right balance between the two models is tricky. Laypeople handle the easier cases, while nurses handle somewhat more complex cases At StrongMinds, Ntulo is very clear with the laypeople being trained about what is and isn’t within their remit. “When a person’s symptoms fall outside depression, this is not your client,” she said. “So you refer the person to the health center, and a clinician there will assess.” At a health center, some of the tasks reserved in the West for a psychiatrist have been shifted to nurses. They can prescribe certain medications, for instance. They consult a flow chart that makes it easier to assess a patient — is he hearing voices or not? — and when symptoms indicate the patient’s problem is beyond their capacity, the nurses refer him to the next level of care above them. Essentially, laypeople handle the easier cases, nurses handle somewhat more complex cases, and the really complex cases may be referred to a psychiatrist for treatment. StrongMinds is not anti-medication on principle, but doesn’t dispense it — partly because current-generation psychiatric medications are less available in developing countries like Uganda, and partly because much of the population would balk at the idea that a mental health condition is something they should treat with medication. Instead, StrongMinds uses the methods it thinks are most effective for the context. It’s a system that makes sense to Ntulo, who says only a minority of people need a psychiatrist. “Everybody else could actually receive services through talk therapy and they’d probably be able to stay well for a long time,” she told me. Patel agrees. He estimates that community-based care could probably address 80 percent of mental health morbidity. “The irony is that 80 percent of the money that’s being spent — this is my back-of-the-envelope calculation — is for that 20 percent that need hospitalization,” he said. “I think the real problem is that we do not spend enough at the base of the pyramid.” Kwabena Kusi-Mensah, a Ghanaian psychiatrist, is a little skeptical about how far community-based care can go. “On paper, it’s a brilliant idea, really fantastic,” he said. “But having watched it be implemented for over 10 years now, there have been serious problems and challenges.” Ghana, he explained, has trained a lot of mid-level staff called community psychiatric officers. These CPOs are like physicians’ assistants who’ve been given some additional training in psychiatry. The idea was that they would work in small villages or towns, to help bridge the treatment gap there. In reality, the CPOs have drifted into major urban centers; now that they’ve got specialized training, they want to use it to secure a better life for themselves. But what’s even more worrying to Kusi-Mensah is that some of them are going over and above what they’ve been trained to do. He worries that this overreach could put patients at risk — if, for instance, they try to treat problems they’re not qualified to treat. For that reason, he actually prefers task-sharing of the sort that Friendship Bench does with its grandmothers. “These are not medical people,” he said, “so they are less likely to overreach and do things they’re not supposed to do.” A carpenter works on a bench near a Friendship Bench site. Brent Stirton/ Getty Images When it comes to tasks that require medical know-how, he’d prefer to see psychiatrists in place to handle those, not mid-level staff. And he told me he’s “hyped up psychiatry” to many young medical students, enticing them to enter the field. But he’s careful not to entrench himself too much in either a pro-psychiatry camp or a pro-community-care camp because he doesn’t want to become too ideologically attached to one or the other. “With extremes of ideology, if you lean too much to one way or another, you end up in a ditch,” he said. “So stay in the middle of the road, is the way I think about it.” What all these community-based programs, and others in a similar vein , have discovered is the power of getting local laypeople to meet folks where they are. Kusi-Mensah emphasized that importing Western norms just doesn’t work: If you want to help people in a place like West Africa, you can’t discount the importance of traditional beliefs, including religion. They might encourage prayers to be said alongside medical treatment “In our cultural background, where things are overspiritualized, our biggest competitors in mental health provision are the prophets,” he told me, referring to those who profess to heal patients with prayers, like in Ghana’s notorious prayer camps. Efforts are now underway to work with, not against, faith-based healers to improve care. Some mental health professionals have gone to the prayer camps and introduced medications as a complementary treatment. Instead of saying “prayer doesn’t work, take this pill instead,” they might encourage prayers to be said alongside medical treatment. This type of collaboration has resulted in improved clinical outcomes for the patients. But working within the camps is controversial because it could give the appearance of condoning them. Less controversial are efforts to partner with religious leaders in various towns and villages. Pastors and imams often double as informal mental health counselors anyway — that’s true in the US, too — so, the thinking goes, why not view them as another cadre of laypeople who can be trained? And for mental health problems that are beyond their ken, why not establish a referral pathway between them and the mental health care professionals? “I’m a bit of a pragmatist,” Kusi-Mensah told me. “So I think the best we’re going to get is this sort of rapprochement, where it’s like, ‘Okay, there’s a spiritual component, so let the pastor handle that, but also there’s a medical component, so the doctor will handle that.’” Related This doctor is taking aim at our broken medical system, one story at a time Western nations like the US favor a biomedical and highly individualistic view of mental health. Compared to, say, a Ghanaian, an American is more likely to conceive of her mental health problem as a brain problem and seek out medication from a psychiatrist. And she’s got a far better chance of accessing one. Yet Americans’ mental health is in such bad shape that the US Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended that doctors screen every patient under 65 for anxiety. And 90 percent of American adults say the US is experiencing a mental health crisis, according to a new poll from CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation. To Patel, this indicates that the biomedical system can’t be the whole solution. “Mental health care is inadequate not because there’s not enough psychiatrists in most countries,” he said. “If that was the case, the US should have a perfect system. But it has a huge number of problems. It is living proof that the problem isn’t only about the lack of psychiatrists.” America once flirted with the idea of community-based care. As Vice explained : When state facilities and asylums began to be shut down in the 1960s , in an initiative known as deinstitutionalization , there was a vision expressed, first by President John F. Kennedy and then by the Carter administration, of a community-centered mental health model that would step in to replace it. But funding cuts from the Reagan administration in the 1980s halted the funding and legislation dedicated to community health centers. It’s taken a few decades, but America now seems ready to experiment with community-based care again as a supplement to psychiatry. What’s exciting is that, this time, it’s taking inspiration from poorer countries. Zimbabwe’s Friendship Benches have made their way to New York City . Walk around Manhattan and you might see a trained layperson sitting on a big orange bench, waiting to listen or talk about issues ranging from depression to addiction. These are issues some of the laypeople have experienced themselves, so they’re nonjudgmental. They literally meet people where they are, lugging their bench around from spot to spot, as part of the Thrive NYC program aiming to create a mental health system that works for everyone. India’s Sangath program for depression, meanwhile, is now being rolled out in Texas, where Patel is collaborating with the Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute and Baylor Scott and White, the largest not-for-profit health care system in the state. And this year, Uganda’s StrongMinds is setting up a pilot in New Jersey . The idea is to address the US mental health gap by reaching people who can’t afford to pay for a licensed professional, with a focus on serving Black people, Indigenous people, and people of color. “We just finished training the team in New Jersey!” Ntulo told me. “They’re going to use the same model we use. It’s an amazing solution for a health system that is so commoditized, like yours.” Related The extraordinary therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugs, explained The Highlight The World to Come 8 Billion Humans Higher Ed’s Future Anti-Vax America An Unradical Revolution Our AI Future Community and Mental Health Give Help keep articles like this free Understanding America’s political sphere can be overwhelming.

(AP Photo/Tsafrir Abayov, File) JERUSALEM, Israel – Israel's Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is holding intense negotiations with his coalition partners to form a government. He's already decided to appoint Itamar Ben-Gvir to a new post as National Security Minister, despite objections from Israel's President Isaac Herzog and the U.S. State Department. Ben Givr’s Otzma Yehudit Party joined other to create the Religious Zionist Party, which won 14 seats in the November 1st elections, making it the third largest party in the Knesset. However, during meetings with the various parities after the election, Israeli President Isaac Herzog was caught on a hot microphone saying the \"entire world\" was anxious about Ben-Gvir. The U.S. State Department condemned Ben-Gvir when he attended an event honoring the late Meir Kahane, who was assassinated in New York in 1990. Kahane advocated expelling Arabs from Israel, and Ben-Gvir admired him as a teenager. Ned Price, State Department Spokesman, said of Ben-Gvir, \"Celebrating the legacy of a terrorist organization is abhorrent. There is no other word for it. It is abhorrent. And we remain concerned, as we said before, by the legacy of Kahane Chai and the continued use of rhetoric among violent right-wing extremists.\" Israeli journalist and columnist Ruthie Blum told CBN News that Ben-Gvir has changed and modified his views from more than thirty years ago. ”What the press is doing is treating him as though he's the same Ben-Gvir as he was many years ago. And as he has said repeatedly, I no longer believe as I used to in the teachings of Rabbi Meir Kahane. I no longer believe that all Arabs should be kicked out of Israel. I only believe that terrorists should be,” Blum said. At the scene of last Wednesday's terror attack that killed two Israelis and injured more than a dozen, Ben-Gvir gave an idea of what actions he would advocate as Israel's National Security Minister. He said,\"I say in a clear way: We must exact a price from terror. Go back to targeted assassinations, to stop the parties in the security prisons, to stop the (Palestinian) authority supporting terrorism payments. This can be done, I'm not talking politics, we have to establish a government as fast as possible.\" Despite the views of the State Department and rest of the Biden administration, who many Israelis believe unfairly meddled in their recent election, an Israel Channel 12 survey from a few days ago showed that nearly a majority of those surveyed, by a 49 to 46 margin, approve of Ben-Gvir's prospective appointment. ***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.*** Did you know?

        "content": "By Robert GreensteinThe American Rescue Plan greatly expanded the Child Tax Credit (CTC) for tax year 2021, reducing child poverty by 30% or more. But the expansion has ended, and the CTC now provides no or only a partial credit to nearly 19 million of the poorest children because their parents lack earnings or their earnings are too low. Some 28% of children under 17, 45% of Black children under 17, and up to 39% of Latino children that age receive no or only a partial credit for this reason. Meanwhile, children in families making as much as $400,000 receive the full credit. Bipartisan negotiations on a CTC expansion are expected in coming weeks as a possible part of year-end tax legislation, raising the question of what the priorities for such an expansion should be. A growing body of research strongly supports the idea of making the CTC “fully refundable” on a permanent basis—i.e., available in full to children in poor families that do not owe federal income tax, as was done in 2021. The research shows poverty can damage children’s health and educational attainment and adversely affect their long-term prospects, while income support for low-income children not only reduces child poverty but can also improve children’s health and educational attainment and their earnings as adults. Moreover, multiple studies have found, the expanded credit of 2021 substantially reduced food insecurity among children, eased other hardships, and achieved these gains without leading parents to leave the workforce or prompting increased spending on alcohol, tobacco, or drugs. A fully refundable CTC would have particularly strong effects among Black and Latino families and advance racial equity. Whether and how policymakers address these issues will have a large bearing on child poverty and children’s well-being. Any CTC expansion as part of compromise year-end tax legislation will require bipartisan support for passage. Full refundability consequently is unlikely to emerge from such discussions except possibly for discrete groups of children as noted below. But based on the CTC’s dramatic poverty-reducing achievements in 2021 and the impressive research findings, the top priority for near-term CTC reform should be to advance the CTC as far toward full refundability as possible and to strengthen it as much as possible for low-income children—and to do so without hurting significant numbers of low- or modest-income families through offsetting budget cuts. Senator Mitt Romney has proposed legislation that would phase in the credit much more rapidly for families with very low earnings; children in families without earnings would remain ineligible, but the credit would rise substantially for millions of children in working-poor and near-poor families. The CTC could do still more for very poor children if policymakers were to go further now and also make the credit fully refundable at least for very young children (for whom there is less expectation of a parent working) and for children whose parents or caretakers are elderly or have work-limiting disabilities. The Romney expansion, however, would be extremely costly. It would raise the credit amount substantially—to higher levels for young children than under the CTC’s 2021 expansion—and unlike the 2021 expansion, which phased out its increase in the amount per child when a family’s income reached about $200,000, it would provide a big increase in CTC benefits to families with incomes in the $200,000 to $500,000 range. To offset the high cost, it would cut other programs on which millions of low- and moderate-income families rely, shrinking the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) significantly and eliminating both “head of household” tax filing status and the tax credit for child care costs. Analysis indicates that about 9 to 10 million children in families with incomes below $50,000 would see their incomes shrink despite the CTC expansion, even as many families in the $200,000 to $500,000 range saw their incomes rise. Whether and how policymakers address these issues will have a large bearing on child poverty and children’s well-being. Policymakers have an opportunity to make significant progress in the period ahead. Should the CTC Be Converted from a Tax Credit to a Spending Program Operated by the Social Security Administration? One question policymakers may face is whether to convert the Child Tax Credit to a spending program administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA). Would doing so strengthen the CTC’s support and boost its long-term prospects? Public opinion research persuasively shows that voters much more strongly support tax benefits—which proponents can portray as tax cuts—than government spending programs. Converting the CTC from a tax credit to a spending program consequently could risk altering public perceptions of it and weakening prospects for its future expansion, including prospects for full refundability. In addition, CTC and EITC supporters have repeatedly secured expansions in these tax credits as part of the horse-trading that occurs when lawmakers assemble tax legislation; policymakers have expanded the CTC, EITC, or both 14 times since 1984, under presidents and Congresses of both parties, and the tax negotiations expected in coming weeks are yet another illustration of this dynamic. Moreover, SSA administration doesn’t appear to confer on a program the political benefits of Social Security itself, as indicated by the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, which is administered by SSA. SSI provides low benefits that leave many of its elderly and disabled beneficiaries in poverty; it suffered cuts in the 1980s and 1990s; and its parsimonious asset limits and various other eligibility parameters are more restrictive today than when the program started. And while the expanded CTC for 2021 reached about 90% of eligible children, SSI’s “take-up rate” is 61%. Converting the CTC from a tax credit to a cash spending program under SSA thus appears ill-advised, at least until the CTC is fully refundable and full refundability is safely embedded in the U.S social program structure for the long run.

The team of Conatel worked tirelessly to make this happen, the company said. The company issued the following statement: “In today’s world, the need for complicated infrastructure is no longer the best economic advantage for underserved countries. The need to supply rural internet access with affordable service has never been more urgent, especially for locations where terrestrial technologies may not reach. Starlink has an active fleet of satellites orbiting the planet, providing consumer-based service.” “Starlink has the capability and the means to support the infrastructure in the internet broadband service programs to the country, which in turn, will attract services to better support education, healthcare, business development, job creations, agriculture, attraction of international businesses, nearshoring development companies, and foreign direct investment.” “Starlink’s services can further support enterprise, government and be complimentary to existing terrestrial telecommunications providers. Starlink is perfectly suited to support resiliency, redundancy and quick response communication needs during disasters. Starlink views the establishment of the Digital Acceleration program to be of extreme importance to Haiti’s underserved communities. Using reliable satellite broadband, like the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Starlink system, can help make affordable broadband a reality for Haiti.” “Starlink’s services will provide Haiti a unique opportunity to leapfrog into the 21st century.” “Starlink can provide connectivity that will help meet Haiti’s connectivity goals, reduce the infrastructure investment required to connect every last mile, and complement traditional internet providers’ service areas.” “The strongest assets of Haiti are the people. Today, the people in rural areas of Haiti do not have readily available access to the internet. With Starlink’s services, the people will be provided the opportunity to obtain reliable internet services. They will be able to obtain remote jobs online, support call centers around the world and obtain vocational school programs directly from their home. They will be able to participate in innovative development programs that will advance their learning capabilities to support the economic development of the country. These services will help enhance the development of the economy of Haiti and its GDP.” “The future development of Haiti is in the hands of those who are empowered to support its ecosystem.” “Together, let’s make a difference. A Starlink system can either be purchased directly from Starlink’s website or through any approved, authorized reseller from the regulator (Conatel).” SpaceX is currently accepting donations of Starlink terminals for several categories, including education and humanitarian efforts. Donors can donate to a Starlink cause or donate by choosing an organization and placing the order. Your feedback is welcome.

He tweeted that the social media website is hiring and shared how to apply. “If you want to rebuild Twitter, then DM me evidence of exceptional ability. If you’re an engineer, this should be a summary of accomplishments and links to code; if you’re a designer, send your portfolio,” Johnson said. He added that remote is fine as long as one’s work is truly excellent. Elon Musk confirmed this, noting that the bar for excellence and trust is higher for overcoming communication difficulties. Remote is fine, but the bar for excellence & trust is higher to overcome communication difficulties — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 27, 2022 Following that, he pointed out that he would ignore messages that don’t send the things he asked for. “The volume of messages means just sending me ‘Hey, I’m really talented and would love to help,’ means you get ignored. Include the things I asked for, please.” In November, Elon Musk spoke about hiring new employees for the social media platform and even opening a second headquarters in Texas in the future. In a recording of the meeting shared with The Verge by an employee, Elon Musk said that he was looking to hire engineers and that Twitter had positions open in sales. Your feedback is welcome.

        "content": "Those who are eagerly waiting for Twitter to crash and burn under Elon Musk’s leadership might end up waiting for a very long time. In fact, critics could end up waiting indefinitely, because if Elon Musk’s recent posts are any indication, Twitter could end up becoming one of the dominant forces in social media in less than two years, with over a billion monthly users. The Tesla CEO shared some slides from a Twitter company talk recently, and they showed that the social media platform is improving. Musk’s slides showed that new user signups are at an all-time high, and the same was true for user active minutes. What’s more, hate speech impressions have gotten lower, and reported impersonation has seemingly stopped after a couple of notable spikes. Twitter’s mDAU also passed the quarter-billion mark. Slides from my Twitter company talk pic.twitter.com/8LLXrwylta— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 27, 2022 (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Musk also shared some ideas for “Twitter 2.0,” which would become “the everything app.” Some new features of the new Twitter were shared by the CEO, from interactive advertisements that could be entertaining to users, videos, encrypted DMs, longform tweets, and a relaunched version of Twitter Blue Verified. Musk also included payments in his Twitter 2.0 slides, though there were no images or teasers posted for the service. Considering how divisive Twitter’s user base is, conservative author Dr. Jordan B. Peterson commented that the stats are “what failure looks like to the left.” Musk did not directly respond to the conservative, nor did he openly agree with Petersen’s statement, but he did post a notable prediction. According to Musk, he actually sees a path to Twitter gaining over a billion monthly users in 12-18 months. That would put the platform within striking distance of WeChat, which has 1.24 billion monthly users, and right in line with TikTok, which has 1 billion monthly active users. I think I see a path to Twitter exceeding a billion monthly users in 12 to 18 months— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 27, 2022 Twitter, of course, is very far from this goal, though a set of compelling new features and a more stable platform would likely help encourage more users to sign up. The addition of useful features in Twitter Blue that would justify its $8 monthly price even to regular consumers would also help a lot. Musk is a hard worker, too, and he has some experience turning struggling companies around. That being said, Elon Musk is notorious for being very optimistic with his timeframes. Thus, if he expects Twitter to hit over 1 billion monthly users in 12-18 months, it would not be a surprise if it takes significantly longer than that — but it will happen. There’s a really good chance that it will take longer than 18 months, but Twitter will probably indeed exceed a billion monthly users under Musk’s leadership.

        "content": "China is starting to become a force in space exploration. Its main focal point of lunar exploration has started bearing fruit, with several successes, including a sample return mission and the first-ever craft to land on the far side. So what’s next for the Lunar Exploration Program? Establishing a research base may be on the cards, but the country doesn’t just plan to stop at the Moon – they are looking far beyond. Recently, China hosted the China-UN Global Partnership Workshop on Space Exploration and Innovation, where Wu Weiren, the head of China’s Lunar Exploration Program, gave an interview to CGTN, one of China’s state-owned news agencies. In it, he detailed the next steps of the lunar exploration program – Chang’e 6, 7, and 8. Chang’e 6 will be another sample return mission, similar to Chang’e 5, which returned a small amount of lunar soil samples about two years ago. Chang’e 6 is expected to come back with a lot more, allowing more scientists to analyze the material makeup of the lunar south pole. UT video covering China’s lunar exploration plans. Chang’e 7 and 8 are expected to work as a team, combining to make a small established lunar research outpost with all the accouterments, such as a rover, lander, orbiter, and a way to get back to orbit. Chang’e 7 itself is also expected to explore some of the caves at the Lunar South pole, where no robot, or human, has ever gone before. There are plenty of other places that no human or robot has gone before, and China hopes to add some of them to its list of firsts. One of the longer-term goals of the country’s space exploration efforts is an asteroid return mission, similar to what Japan achieved with the Hayabusa missions. In China’s view, understanding the composition of asteroids is key to defending from them, pointing out that the UN listed an unexpected asteroid impact as the number one extinction-level threat to humanity. The world’s biggest country is vested in ensuring that doesn’t happen. Beyond the asteroid belt, China plans to enact a sample return mission from Mars, as well as visit the outer reaches of the solar system. Details of both still need to be fleshed out, but a sample return from Mars would tread where some ongoing missions are actively going. One to the edge of the solar system would be novel unless you consider the Voyager craft that launched almost 50 years ago. UT Q&A about China’s human exploration plans. Following in other agencies’ footsteps could also lead to cooperating with them, which was another point that Mr. Wu stressed in his interview. To help build up the research base on the Moon, China is looking to coordinate with other space-faring agencies in the BRICS (Brazil, Russian, India, China, and South Africa) countries, as well as others in the Middle East and Europe. Notably absent from the press release was a mention of the other major power in space – the US. Deteriorating relations between the two countries could be responsible for the oversight. However, many missions detailed in China’s plan, such as a lunar research base and Mars Sample Return mission, are also explicit goals of NASA. The timelines for each mission would still put NASA firmly in the lead when it comes to completing any of them first, but they do leave open the possibility of another, less high drama, space race in the not-too-distant future.

        "content": "Humanity is getting better a planetary defense. At least from external threats from outer space. As long as they’re just dumb rocks that follow the laws of physics. And a group of extraordinary humans proved it last week when the planetary defense community jumped into action to accurately track and predict exactly where a relatively small meteor would fall on November 19th. That meteor, now known as 2022 WJ1, was first noticed by the Catalina Sky Survey at around midnight EST on the 19th (the time zone in which it ended up landing). Catalina is one of the most prolific discoverers of asteroids and is a crucial link in the planetary defense chain. A NASA press release details the steps that come afterward that result in a successful landing prediction. 2022 WJ1 was pretty small – only about 1 m wide, and posed no actual threat to anyone or anything on the ground. But the planetary defense network is designed to catch much bigger potential threats. The fact that it reacted with such speed shows that it is becoming more and more capable and will be much more likely to find any potentially devastating events, such as the Chelyabinsk meteor in 2013, which caused 1400 injuries and around $33 million in property damage. Door cam of 2022 WJ1 streaking across the sky at 3:27 AM on November 19th.Credit – Jim Geary YouTube Channel The Chelyabinsk meteor was 20 times the size of 2022 WJ1 and, therefore, would have been much easier to see if astronomers had the same resources in place as they do now. Walking through how 2022 WJ1 was tracked helps illuminate how much planetary detection has improved. After Catalina first detected the meteor, it immediately sent a notice to the Minor Planet Center, a central data hub for small bodies surrounding the Earth. From there, the entry was picked up by automatically Scout, a program from the Center for Near Earth Object Studies, which attempted to assess the likelihood that 2022 WJ1 would impact the Earth. Its original assessment, posted 7 minutes after the asteroid was initially discovered, showed a 25% chance of hitting the Earth. That’s where the rest of the planetary defense community came in. UT video on how we track asteroids Catalina continued tracking the asteroid throughout the night, but several other astronomers, including a group of amateurs from the Farpoint Observatory in Eskridge, Kansas, a little southwest of Topeka. Over 600 asteroids have been discovered there, so this is another feather in their cap. As the data continued streaming in, there were a total of 46 observations made of the 2022 WJ1 in the three hours following its initial discovery. The University of Hawai’i made the last observation about a half hour before its predicted impact. At the predicted time – 3:27 AM, and at the predicted place – southern Ontario, Canada, a fireball lit up the sky and was captured on myriad door cams and other recording devices, resulting in some pretty impressive videos. After the fact, plenty of other astronomers spent time analyzing the asteroid’s trajectory, even going so far as to come up with models that showed how the Earth’s actual gravitational pull caused 2022 WJ1 to fall to its firey doom – or join the larger Earth’s biosphere, depending on how you look at it. Fraser discusses tracking of 2022 WJ1. As it didn’t cause any harm, and there were no safety implications, this was an excellent exercise in the search for potentially dangerous asteroids, and we do seem to be getting better at it. This sixth detection comes fourteen years after the first detection of 2008 TC3 but less than a year after the last detection of 2022 EB5 over the Nubian desert earlier this year. That last event dropped plenty of meteorites across the desert, and there are likely some from 2022 WJ1 scattered around southern Ontario. Now it’s up to the meteorite hunters to find them, as the planetary defense community gave them an excellent head start.

The National Geographic Explorer 114 is manufactured by company Explore Scientific. Featuring a 114mm aperture and a focal length of 500mm, this instrument allows the astronomer to get up close to some of the most dazzling deep-sky targets, splitting double stars with ease, get lost in star clusters and magnify nebulas. The rugged surface of the moon is also stunning through the eyepiece (26mm and 9.7mm Plössls are supplied), along with the planets of our solar system. Aimed at beginners, the Explorer 114 comes with a simple equatorial mounting system. This enables observers to track chosen targets as the Earth rotates for clear images should astronomers wish to dabble in some basic smartphone astrophotography with this exquisite telescope. Also included in the package is an adjustable tripod, red dot finderscope, Stellarium computer software and star map, supplying the astronomer with everything they need for a well-equipped observing session. If you’re wanting to make short work of creating exquisite deep-sky astrophotos, then look no further than the SV550 APO triplet refractor. This Cyber Monday, it’s a steal from Amazon with $160 off the retail price (opens in new tab) . Thanks to low-dispersion ED glass and correction glass, the Svbony SV550 is able to rid observations and images of chromatic aberration, which can often plague bright night-sky targets. What’s more, the telescope also makes use of an air-spaced triple optical system, which eliminates any blue or purple fringing. The SV550 is also made of magnesium alloy material for a lightweight design that makes the instrument easy to carry, while a 180mm dovetail plate ensures that this refractor is versatile for fitting to your chosen mount and tripod.

With a decent 16% Black Friday saving the telescope also comes with all the accessories you need to get started straight out of the box. Two eyepieces, (25mm and 10mm) the telescope mount and tripod (preassembled), a StarPointer finderscope, accessory tray and StarSense Explorer phone dock for use with smartphones. Download the StarSense app and quickly use the telescope to navigate the night sky without any prior knowledge of the night sky, and place it in the dock to align with the telescope itself. The remarkable thing about this particular GorillaPod kit, which is available at Adorama with a massive 60% saving , is that it has arms. You can use it to hold phones, lights, microphones or even a small secondary camera like a GoPro . You can also hold the 'arms' while recording a video or selfie. Joby has made a name for itself over the last few decades as a purveyor of an innovative tripod style that uses articulated ball joints that twist around anything and everything to give you the flexibility to stabilize your camera wherever you may find yourself. That might be railings, lamp posts, benches or anything else you may come across in the urban landscape, but also natural landscape features like rocks and trees, excellent for timelapse photography and astrophotography when you don't want to carry a larger tripod. Despite only weighing 0.84kg/1.85lb, the Joby GorillaPod 5k can hold up to — as the name suggests — 5k/11lbs of kit, which is very impressive for such a small tripod. If you're off out on a trek or simply don't have enough space or weight allowance left in your luggage, that is where this tripod comes into its own — when folded, it is a mere 43.18cm long, so it takes up hardly any space. Check out our guides to the best tripods and best travel tripods to discover more. The Canon EOS R10 mirrorless camera was only launched a few months ago but you can already save $100 on the retail price than the retail price over at Walmart for just $879 , a price we spotted it this Black Friday weekend and we're hoping to see continue over to Cyber Monday. This entry-level APS-C crop sensor mirrorless camera is fitted with a 24.2 Megapixel CMOS image sensor that captures 4K UHD 30p video footage. When we look at the maximum ISO sensitivity of 32,000 we're confident it's strong enough to cope with most casual astrophotographer's needs as well as more generalist use. It's suited for portraits, landscapes and a bit of wildlife thanks to the Dual Pixel CMOS AF autofocusing system (that can track people, animals and vehicles) and its 15FPS maximum burst speed for stills photographs. Take a look at our round-up of the Best mirrorless cameras and Best cameras for photos and videos overall if you want to shop around, though. The Autel Robotics EVO II V2 Pro has an on-board 6K camera to capture large stills images while flying for up for 40 minutes and in that time, if you can manage it, the drone can be controlled for up to a distance of 9KM. In the market for a rugged 6K drone? This is probably one of the best drones out there.

It also has two Plössl eyepieces at 26mm and 9.7mm sizes with 1.25-inch mounts, and a red dot StarPointer finderscope for targeting and calibration.

Celestron is an icon of skywatching hardware, so the instrument comes from manufacturer with a proven track record of quality hardware.

Save $70 on the Celestron Nature DX 8x42 binoculars this Black Friday from one of our favorite optics manufacturers in the stargazing game.

Offering a relatively wide field with 8x magnification, the Nature DX 8x42 binoculars make it easy to track moving subjects because they don't disappear out of view quickly. Pair that with decent 42mm objective lenses and these are good for general observing, especially when light levels start to drop near twilight.

For video lovers, it also captures 4KUHD 60p footage. Save 25% on the Nikon ProStaff 3s 10x42 binoculars with this Black Friday binocular deal that is still running this weekend. A big bargain on these high-quality binoculars, the ProStaff 3S 10x42 binoculars are waterproof up to 1m and you can continue to submerge them for up to 10 minutes, so even if you drop them in a lake you can (theoretically) take your time fishing them out. These slender, lightweight binoculars weigh just 20.3 oz / 575 g and are Nitrogen-purged which means they're fogproof — something astronomers and wildlife spotters hate when using binoculars as it can stop binocular use at crucial moments when moving between warm and cold environments.

Save $400 on a lens that's practically asking to take astrophotographs. The Canon RF 15-35mm f/2.8L IS USM lens is an RF-mount (mirrorless) ultra-wide zoom lens from Canon. It's great for a wide variety of photographic disciplines, but none more perfect than astrophotography. A fast maximum aperture of f/2.8 is constant throughout the zoom range which maximizes light input to the camera. L-series quality optics from Canon make the image sharp edge to edge throughout the zoom range as we found out in our Canon RF 15-35mm f/2.8L IS USM lens review . Taking it off the tripod and going handheld? Dont worry, this lens has five stops of Image Stabilization (IS) to steady your shots. A quiet Ultra-Sonic Motor (USM) provides fast autofocusing for Canon mirrorless cameras for daytime use, too.

The Hulu + Disney Plus Black Friday Bundle (opens in new tab) is a combo deal that offers full access to Hulu and Disney Plus for just $4.98 a month. That's down from the usual $7.99 a month of Hulu alone and throws in access to Disney's entire catalog of Star Wars films, TV shows and other science fiction titles.

Walmart is offering this hefty camera deal on Black Friday and it is the best Sony camera deal we've seen so far. Not only does it come with the mammoth 61MP mirrorless monster that can also shoot 4KUHD 30p video, but it has a whole host of camera accessories, to boot. This is the best Sony mirrorless camera Black Friday deal we've seen so far. The kit is shown as including: a Koah flight case, a Sony 64GB V60 SDXC memory card, two spare Koah batteries and a Koah double battery charger, a suite of Corel photo and video editing software and a Zeiss cleaning kit, plus a camera battery grip. Every other A7R IV or IVA deal we've seen is either more expensive or doesn't come with the amount of extra that this bundle from Walmart does, so we think this is the time to invest in Sony mirrorless if you're going to. NBC’s streaming service is great for the whole family thanks to new movie releases like Nope or Minions: The Rise of Gru, but it’s even better for sci-fi fans.

Save 23% on this beginner-friendly refractor from Celestron. xxx We reviewed the Celestron Inspire 100AZ earlier this year and we found that, with weather permitting, we could get impressive views of the moon and Saturn. We were even able to spot the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and some other bright star clusters. We were so impressed with it that we've named the Celestron Inspire 100AZ the best telescope for beginners and we've included it in our round-up of the best telescopes overall. A refractor with an Alt-Azimuth mount, this 100mm aperture, 600mm focal length telescope is about as good as it gets for beginner astronomers or those that want to get into stargazing without breaking the bank. Now with over $100 off for Black Friday it's never been more affordable. With its 102mm aperture and f/7 focal ratio, astrophotographers can enjoy crisp and clear images of their favorite night sky targets with the Svbony SV503. What's more, and this Black Friday, you can snap up this exquisite instrument at 20% less (opens in new tab) than the retail price. The Svbony SV503 energy-dispersed glass improves on pesky color-fringing, while the dual rack-and-pinion focuser can be fine tuned to bring planets, galaxies, nebulas and the rugged surface of the moon into sharp focus. While this refractor doesn’t come with a tripod or mount, the Svbony SV503 offers a metal hoop dovetail, focuser wheel, lens cover and tube ring, allowing astronomers to accessorize their way for optimum results. The largest binocular of Celestron’s SkyMaster range, the 25x100 binocular ensures superb sharp focus across the field of view — and now you can enjoy over $100 off (opens in new tab) on crystal clear sights of a selection of targets, from the moon to deep-sky objects such as the Orion Nebula (Messier 42). This binocular also provides excellent terrestrial views during the day. Featuring high-quality BAK-4 prisms and multi-coated optics for excellent contrast, the SkyMaster’s 100mm objective lens and 4mm exit pupil allow your eyes to collect light in a variety of low-light and long-range conditions. The elliptical shape of the Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 31) can be picked up with excellent clarity, while the member stars of the Pleiades (Messier 45) sparkle like diamonds when viewed through the optical system. If you prefer to stay local, the moon’s rugged surface can be brought into breathtaking focus, while the rings of Saturn and belts of Jupiter are magnified to perfection. Weighing in at 8.75 lbs (3.97 kg), the Celestron SkyMaster 25x100 is a touch on the heavy side, so for stable views we recommend purchasing a suitable tripod (check out our best tripods ) to avoid shaky sights of night-sky targets. The binocular is supplied with an integrated tripod adapter and deluxe carry case. Completely transform your bedroom or living room for less than $20 with this perfect holiday gift for space lovers. Save a huge 60% on the original price of the BlissLight Sky Lite over at Walmart with this easy-to-use, button-controlled star projector which even has a six-hour timer for those that like to go to sleep to the ambient lighting. We reviewed the BlissLights Sky Lite 2.0 earlier this year and gave it 3.5/5 stars because it was easy to use and gave decent ambient lighting, so we're confident that the Sky Lite is a bargain star projector in this Black Friday deal. Save 21% on the Celestron AstroMaster 70AZ refractor telescope which comes with an Alt-Az mount that is beginner-friendly. The telescope features a 70mm aperture and a 900mm focal length to provide good views of the moon and stars.

All this for under $150 makes this a Black Friday telescope deal worth having. Save more than 20% off in this Black Friday camera deal on the Sony A7R III. The mirrorless camera, known for its superb full-frame CMOS 42.4MP image sensor is now $500 off in this Amazon deal. It's perfect for astrophotography due to its extended ISO range (50-102,400) but it lends itself to many styles of photographers and videographers with a host of useful features like EyeAF autofocusing for sharp portraits, and 4K HDR video capture. Editing is easy as well because the A7R III has up to 15 stops of dynamic range to retain detail in the brightest highlights and blackest shadows, meaning image files (or video) are flexible when editing in Lightroom or Photoshop. Known the world over as one of the most iconic line of telescopes, the much-loved Celestron NexStar 8SE is now on sale with $200 for Black Friday over at Amazon and Adorama . The line has been going since the 1970s but Celestron's 8SE, the largest in the NexStar line-up, is truly exceptional. A Schmidt-Cassegrain design, this catadioptric telescope takes advantage of a hybrid technology between refractor and reflector telescope designs to provide a massive 2032 mm (80-inch) focal length and huge 203.2mm (8-inch) aperture in a tiny package. Suitable for all kinds of astronomers it may not immediately be friendly to beginners but it has such breadth of use that, when paired with one of the best eyepieces , you can observe the moon, stars, planets, nebulas and more in exquisite detail. Ultimate sharpness and incredibly bright, the NexStar 8SE ships with a red dot finderscope and a 25mm eyepiece — which you can upgrade as and when you're ready to take astronomy to the next level.

A 5x24 finderscope helps you locate night sky objects easily before fine-tuning through the eyepieces with more precision. Celestron also bundles free access to the Starry Night software that gives information on 36,000 celestial objects for the uninitiated. Save 73% on the Astronaut Starry Sky Star Projector . The projector is an astronaut that can be posed into different positions and projects stars through its visor. It has eight in-built nebula effects and the projector can be set to a timer for those using it to sleep. The ideal space gift, save a massive 73% in this Black Friday star projector deal which takes the price down to just $7.58. We said in our Astronaut space star projector review that anything under $35 is a bargain, so $7.58 is insane. It should suit any wall or ceiling thanks to the adjustable projection angle and we love it as an early holiday season gift. What we like about the projector is its surprisingly good build quality, the fact it's packed with impressive and effective lighting and its general appeal to all space fans, whether young or older. Paramount’s Black Friday deal for its Paramount Plus streaming service is one of the best streaming deals we’ve found so far, offering a huge amount of content at a 50% discount. That equates to around $2 per month, and there are plenty of sci-fi shows to be found for your money. Star Trek is the big one, with the entirety of the TV show’s 860 episodes to watch (as well as the movies), but there are newer sci-fi shows like videogame tie-in Halo, classic mystery thriller Twin Peaks, and The Twilight Zone reboot too. The Celestron SkyMaster 15x70 binoculars are currently discounted by 25% (opens in new tab) , making them an excellent buy for budding skywatchers who want to view larger deep-sky objects. Since our initial post about this deal yesterday, they have been reduced by a couple more dollars, but we expect this to be the lowest they will go. You can read our Celestron SkyMaster Pro 15x70 binoculars review to get a feel for the version of the binos that are on sale, but note that these are slightly less rugged and not waterproof, unlike the pro version (which cost more than double). If you're not planning on using your binos in inclement weather, for the price, these binoculars will see you right. Because of the high magnification, you should invest in one of the best tripods so you don't have to worry about wobble spoiling your views. Once set up in the right conditions, you can see the Andromeda Galaxy and the bright Messier galaxies and nebulas based on the list drawn up by Charles Messier . All-in-all, these binoculars will give users an enjoyable star and galaxy-gazing experience at a very reasonable price. HP’s highly-rated VR headset, the Reverb G2, is one of the best VR headsets around. Better yet, the manufacturer has cut the price by 50%.

Unlike the Meta Quest 2, you will need a PC to connect to, but it offers a 2160x2160 resolution in each eye and excellent audio. For more, be sure to check out our HP Reverb G2 review where we awarded it 4-stars and noted how easy it is to set up.

With the G2’s lengthy, six-meter cable, it’s less restrictive than many wired headsets, too, and it’s comfortable for longer periods of time – perfect if you’re up to your eyeballs in No Man’s Sky VR. We love a good Lego kit here at Space. In fact, the only thing we love more is a good Lego kit at half price which is exactly what we've found over at Walmart. You can get the Lego Galaxy Explorer set for just $50 (opens in new tab) , reduced down from $100. The Galaxy Explorer is a modern take on the classic 1979 Lego set of the same name, and it's an impressive mash-up of retro-styling and modern design. It comes with 4 minifigures - 2 red and 2 white astronauts, and has a total of 1254 pieces, making it an involved, but not massive build. We actually checked out the set earlier this year and gave it a perfect score of 5 stars (check out our Lego Galaxy Explorer review to see our full thoughts). We even compared it to the original model as our reviewer still had theirs. We're covering all the best Black Friday Lego deals on our main hub, so head over there for more savings on Star Wars, Space, and Marvel themed kits. There is no shortage of science fiction on streaming services right now and nowhere is that more true than at Hulu and right now you can get a year of Hulu for just $1.99 a month (opens in new tab) , a 75% discount of its regular $7.99 fee. The Black Friday Hulu offer is not as deep a discount as the streaming service's 2021 deal , which offered a year's subscription at just 99 cents a month, but it's still a bargain for fans of The Orville, Rick and Morty and other sci-fi shows that call Hulu home. After all, where else are you going to see the new Hulu original \"Prey,\" which is the latest entry in the Predator franchise? Hulu is making this deal available primarily to new subscribers, but if you are a lapsed subscriber - and you have not used Hulu in the last month - you may be able to qualify for the offer.

At $479, this DJI Mini 2 drone bundle is $200 off at Adorama (opens in new tab) and is the best price we've seen for Black Friday this year. The bundle is on sale for 29% off and comes with the drone, as well as a microSD card, carrying case and several other extras for your aerial or sky photography needs. As we noted in our DJI Mini 2 review , this drone is small enough (it weighs 249 grams) that it's portable and lightweight, and also does not require you to register it for casual flying. You will need to check your local drone regulations, though. It carries a 12 MP camera for both still images and video and has about 23 minutes of flight time (according to our tests) before it returns home on a 25% battery life mark.

The Celestron AstroMaster 70AZ refractor telescope is currently at a discount of over 20% (opens in new tab) which makes a perfect gift for beginner astronomers this Black Friday. It features a 70mm aperture and a powerful 900mm focal length that takes you in for detailed lunar views. Not only that but thanks to the fully coated objective lens it's ideal for land-based viewing as well: wildlife, landscapes and more are adequate subjects during the day.

The telescope also ships with everything you need to get started stargazing: a full-height tripod, two eyepieces, and a red dot finderscope to find your celestial objects before refining positioning through the eyepiece. During our Celestron AstroMaster 70AZ review we noted that the achromatic refractor avoids distracting 'false color' and is already good value, which is even more evident now given the discount. Suitable for adults but also easy enough to set up for younger astronomers and kids, the refractor weighs just 11 lbs (5 kg) so taking it out to dark sky locations, or just to get away from the city lights, is simple. The tripod also comes with a simple Alt-Az controlled tripod with a smooth panning handle to locate night sky objects quickly. It requires no tools to set up and is one of the simplest telescopes in Celestron's refractor range. Read our guide to the best telescopes if you want to shop around.

        "content": "Following the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk, many companies have paused or stopped their advertising campaigns. A report from Media Matters for America said that over half of Twitter’s top 100 advertisers are no longer advertising on the platform. In September, Twitter promoted ads alongside child pornography. Some of the brands called Twitter out on this and either paused or suspended their ad campaigns. Some advertisers that were not affected by Twitter’s accidental promotion of ads with child pornography continued to advertise with the platform. And some of these brands who did so paused their campaigns when Elon Musk took over. A key issue is that in the past, Twitter has been lenient toward child predators, yet advertisers have been advertising with the platform for many years. It wasn’t until Elon Musk bought the platform that Twitter made removing child sexual exploitation material priority number one. Some of these advertisers are only now pausing or suspending their ad campaigns after Elon Musk took over. Removing child exploitation is priority #1. Please reply in comments if you see anything that Twitter needs to address. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 24, 2022 A Twitter spokesperson said that the platform “has zero tolerance for child sexual exploitation,” but there is a case where the platform refused to remove videos of two children being abused, and it took the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to step in for Twitter to remove the content. The Media Matters report stated that Elon Musk “has continued his rash of brand unsafe actions — including amplifying conspiracy theories, unilaterally reinstating banned accounts such as that of former President Donald Trump, courting and engaging with far-right accounts, and instituting a haphazard verification scheme that allowed extremists and scammers to purchase a blue check. This last move, in particular, opened the platform up to various fraud and brand imitations.” There was no mention of Twitter’s new priority number one, which is the removal of child pornography from its platform. Additionally, many of these brands continued to advertise while Trump was president and active on the platform. Comparison. The two following lists show companies that stopped advertising when Elon Musk took over and companies whose ads were published alongside explicit and illegal content. Companies That Stopped Publishing Ads When Elon Musk Bought Twitter: Abbott Laboratories Allstate Corporation AMC Networks American Express Company AT&T Big Heart Petcare BlackRock, Inc.

Brands   Brands whose ads Twitter promoted alongside CSE Content. There were over 30 brands affected, and the following list is just some of the brands that were reported to be affected. Dyson Mazda Forbes Walt Disney NBC Universal Coca-Cola Cole Haan a children’s hospital PBS Kids A spokesperson for both Disney and Coca-Cola spoke out against Twitter promoting their ads alongside the CSE content, yet NBCUniversal confirmed that it asked Twitter to remove the ads associated with the content. David Maddocks, brand president at Cole Haan, told Reuters that either Twitter fixes this or Cole Haan would do so, including by not buying Twitter ads. Mazda USA also said it would be prohibiting its ads from appearing on Twitter profile pages. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Although a handful of brands were upset over Twitter’s promoting ads along CSE, many of those brands that quit Twitter following Elon Musk’s acquisition were advertising up until recently. This includes both brands who had their content promoted alongside child pornography as well as those who didn’t. For all of these brands who continued to advertise despite Twitter’s problem with CSE, the question remains: is advertising with Elon Musk worse than alongside the exploitation of children? This is a question Eliza Bleu had for General Motors when the automaker first suspended its campaign after Elon Musk’s acquisition of the platform. Bleu is one of Twitter’s toughest critics who, up until recently, Twitter ignored. Elon Musk agrees with Bleu that CSE should be removed from the platform and has made it priority number one. I would like to know too — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 23, 2022 “Twitter has a long history of knowingly refusing to remove child sexual abuse material at scale. This issue has been covered by the corporate media and called out by governments around the globe.” “Over 32 brands removed ads from Twitter when the Reuters pieces came out in September of this year because of child sexual abuse material on Twitter. I think that General Motors’ lack of concern over sexually abused children says a lot. Survivors buy cars too. There are more survivors out there than these brands might think,” Bleu told Teslarati in October. Bleu told Teslarati on Sunday that these brands only care about the world’s most vulnerable when it is politically advantageous. “Where was the outrage, pearl-clutching, and solidarity for the minor survivors sexually exploited on Twitter over the past 10+ years?” “These brands only care about the world’s most vulnerable when it’s politically advantageous. They only care about the vulnerable populations who buy products, vote, and have money. It’s manipulative and gaslighting.” “Thank you to the brands who took a stand against Twitter in September over this very real crime. My hope is that under the new leadership, the platform will continue to prioritize the removal of child sexual exploitation, and the brands that left in September can return knowing that specific issue will not negatively impact their brand as well as children around the globe.” The question remains: Which is worse for Twitter advertisers: child sexual exploitation or Elon Musk?

        "content": "Tesla has plans to ramp its electric vehicle production by a notable degree in the coming years, and with the company’s constant innovations, it would need to secure a lot of resources, from battery raw materials to computer chips.  In this light, reports have emerged suggesting that Tesla has established a semiconductor joint venture in Jinan of eastern China’s Shandong Province. The joint venture is intended to supply automotive chip and electronics solutions. Tesla partnered with Swiss automotive semiconductor company Annex for the joint venture, which boasts a registered capital of $150 million. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); As per a report from Chinese tech publication ijiwei, Tesla holds a 5% equity in the company for now, while Annex holds a 55% stake, and the Jinan Zurich Annex Equity Investment Fund Partnership holds a 40% stake. It should be noted that the Jinan Zurich fund acquired Annex this past June in a $5 billion deal. Tesla seems to have set up a semiconductor company in China called ANNEX SEMICONDUCTOR (Jinan) Co., Ltd. with legal representative Thomas Enoch and registered capital of US$150 million. pic.twitter.com/8y6DvpcEjU— Chris Zheng (@ChrisZheng001) November 25, 2022 Tesla has a formidable partner in Annex, as the Swiss company is among the global leaders in automotive system-on-chip (SoC), microcontroller (MCU), and processor, image sensor, and power device products. This likely provides the joint venture with the necessary technical know-how and experience to develop optimal semiconductors for the electric vehicle maker and its products. If the recent reports from China prove accurate, it would appear that Tesla is making a serious play for the semiconductor market. Just recently, for example, reports have suggested that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) would be Tesla’s supplier of choice for its next-generation FSD computer, which would reportedly be manufactured at 4 nm and 5 nm processes. Tesla’s chip order from TSMC is reportedly substantial, so much so that it would effectively make the American electric vehicle maker one of the chipmaker’s top seven customers next year. These reports present a pretty exciting picture for Tesla next year, as the Cybertruck, the first vehicle in the company’s lineup confirmed to have a next-generation computer, would also be entering production in 2023.

        "content": "One of the benefits of having a cluster of satellites orbiting another planet is that scientists can then analyze that planet’s weather. Sometimes in that process, they find patterns that are strikingly similar to those found on our home planet. That was the case recently when a group of scientists from ESA used data from Mars Express to analyze cloud formation on Mars. To no one’s surprise, dust seemed to be at the core of that formation. But the resultant clouds looked very much like those found here on Earth – in the tropics. The paper, recently published in Icarus, utilized data from two of Mar Express’ cameras: the Visual Monitoring Camera (VMC) and the High-Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC), and another camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. All of those cameras were focused on one particular event – the formation of clouds surrounding the Martian North Pole during its springtime. Cloud formation is common in that location at that time of year, but this is the first time so much data-collecting power has been turned toward it. In particular, two notable dust storms formed during the springtime of 2019, when the data for the paper was collected. That data included actual photographs that showed something familiar to storm watchers on Earth – spiral patterns. A hurricane-like spiral storm on Mars.Credit – ESA / DLR / FU Berlin One of the most distinct pictures from the HRSC images shows a spiral pattern that seemed very similar to a hurricane (or cyclones as they are called in some parts of the world) on Earth. They reach between 1000 and 2000 km in size and are thought to be caused by similar patterns to those that form hurricanes here. Similarities between Earth and Martian clouds don’t stop there. Some of Earth’s more picturesque cloud formations involve a “texturing” pattern that makes them look like sand. A similar pattern happens on Mars, and “textured” clouds can be seen in some of the images Mars Express sent back. These textures are formed by a convection pattern where, on Earth, air containing water is heated by the Sun, causing it to rise, and eventually, the water condenses to form clouds. On Mars, however, water is not so readily available, so the Sun heats the dust-laden air, causing it to rise similarly and then fall into gaps between the pockets of hot air containing the dust. This overall “closed-cell convection” causes the textured pattern seen in the image. Mars’ atmosphere has been gone for some time – could we bring it back? Mars and Earth aren’t the only places this phenomenon occurs, though. Venus also has closed-cell convection, as evidenced by data collected by Mars Express’ sister craft – Venus Express. Since Venus also lacks significant water and has a much thicker atmosphere than either Earth or Mars, it seems the fundamental processes that cause these cloud formations don’t care much about that part of the environment, at least. Finding similar patterns elsewhere in the solar system is both comforting and enlightening. Using those similarities to help predict Martian weather, especially for future crewed missions, is one way that long-standing missions such as Mars Express can continue to help contribute to humanity’s long-term exploration of space.

        "description": "In a surprise twist, NASA has suggested it will reexamine its naming policies, due to the controversy surrounding the JWST. The post Based on the JWST Controversy, NASA is re-Evaluating the way it Names Spacecraft appeared first on Universe Today.",
        "content": "In 2015, the naming of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) became the subject of controversy when it was revealed that the namesake (NASA’s administrator between 1961 and 1968) was involved in the infamous “Lavender Scare.” This refers to the period in the late 1940s and early 50s when the U.S. State Department purged thousands of individuals from their positions due to allegations of homosexuality. In 2021, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson requested a formal and public report and tasked NASA’s Chief Historian Brian C. Odom with investigating the matter. In their final report, titled “NASA Historical Investigation into James E. Webb’s Relationship to the Lavender Scare” (aka. the NASA James Webb Historical Report). In it, NASA claimed that their investigation found no direct evidence that Webb was a “leader of or a proponent” of the policy; therefore, they would not be renaming the JWST. In a surprise twist, it appears that NASA may reexamine its naming policy and recommend changes. According to a statement released by the American Astronomical Society (AAS), Administrator Nelson agreed that the policy needs to be reevaluated. “Many AAS members are concerned about the response of NASA to the JWST name and process, and we wanted to provide a brief update,” stated the AAS Board of Trustees. “In response to our most recent letter, Administrator Nelson replied that NASA’s Acting Chief Historian as well as a contract historian were reviewing records and that NASA would share the findings publicly after completion. Nelson also agreed that the mission naming policy for NASA must be reexamined and that will also be shared. We await these results.” This is unsurprising, considering how the JWST got its name in the first place. Beyond the controversy surrounding Webb’s role in the Lavender Scare, the naming met with backlash from the scientific community because it broke with tradition. Unlike previous observatories named after the scientists or the principles they were investigating (all of NASA’s Great Observatories), Webb was named by former NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe (2001 to 2004). O’Keefe did this without the usual consultations or contest process and selected a name that had no bearing on the observatory’s mission. NASA’s decision not to rename the observatory has naturally met with anger and disappointment from the LGBTQI+, scientific, and other communities. Jason Wright, a Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Penn State, is also a member of the Sexual and Gender Minority Alliance (SGMA), the committee that advises the American Astronomical Society (AAS) on LGBTQ+ issues. During the investigation, Wright led the effort to learn more about NASA’s investigation and even spoke personally to Odom about the matter. As Wright stated on his website (Astroweb): “At this point, NASA’s resistance has gone from stubbornness to recalcitrance. Already, NASA employees are refusing to use the name in prominent publications. The Royal Astronomical Society says it expects authors of MNRAS not to use the name. The American Astronomical Society has twice asked the administrator to reopen the naming process (and received no response!). This is an error that only grows as NASA refuses to fix it.“ The ASS statement also included a reminder about the policy regarding their scientific journals, which states that “the acronym JWST need not be spelled out upon its first use in scientific papers.” At this juncture, it’s not entirely clear if the AAS’ is representative of any actual plans or if this was merely lip service from the Administrator. Regardless, the administration’s refusal to rename the JWST, coupled with their apparent willingness to revisit their naming policies, sends an admittedly mixed message. Illustration of NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope. Credits: NASA For starters, NASA has a specific policy regarding the naming of spacecraft, probes, and missions that has been in place since the early 1960s and Project Mercury. This policy was established by the then-named Ad Hoc Committee to Name Space Projects and Objects, founded in 1960. Based on the precedent established with the Explorer and Pioneer spacecraft, the committee emphasized that “flight names should be suggested of the mission and reflect the series of which they were a part.” This is known as the “Cortright” system, which the Project Designation Committee adopted in 1961. As per the NASA Management Instruction 4-3-1 (NMI): “Each project name will be a simple euphonic word that will not duplicate or be confused with other NASA or non-NASA project titles. When possible and if appropriate, names will be chosen to reflect NASA’s mission. Project names will be serialized when appropriate, thus limiting the number of different names in use at any one time; however, serialization will be used only after successful flight or accomplishment has been achieved.” In 2000, the administration instituted NASA Policy Directive 7620.1I (NPD), which made a few minor addendums to their naming procedure. As per the policy, naming missions is the responsibility of NASA administrators and assistant administrators to: “Initiate the name selection process by assembling an ad hoc name selection team consisting of one member representing the office in which a project name is under consideration, e.g., Science Mission Directorate, and one member representing every other NASA Headquarters office participating in the management of a significant element of or having other major involvement in the project. This will include the Public Affairs Officer co-located in the NASA Headquarters program office initiating the name selection process. The Official-in-Charge will lead the team or designate a leader.” 1963 photo showing Dr. William H. Pickering, (center) JPL Director, President John F. Kennedy, (right). NASA Administrator James Webb in the background. Credit: NASA Once assembled, the ad-hoc special project name team must solicit suggestions, particularly from the “responsible NASA Centers and contractors.” After completing deliberations, they are required to make specific recommendations to the Associate Administrator for the Office of Communications. The A.A. for the Office of Communications is then responsible for reviewing the recommendations of this special committee, making a selection, and submitting it to the Administrator for final approval. However, this process is often implemented informally. As former NASA Chief Historian Bill Barry described: “The Official-in-Charge of the appropriate NASA Headquarters office is responsible for identifying missions that need a name and assembling a committee to recommend names. How that committee works is up to the Official in Charge and there really isn’t a “preferred” method [for naming craft]. Most of the proposals come with a name chosen by the Principal Investigator and NASA normally adopts these names.” None of these procedures were followed regarding the name selection for the JWST. In this case, the name was chosen in 2004 by former NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe (2001-2004) without going through the usual channels. As such, a review of the naming procedures would seem entirely redundant at this time, as they were not followed. And as noted, it is unclear why a review of the naming process is needed if NASA insists on keeping the name for the JWST. In short, it’s an admittedly mixed message and could be little more than lip service. Time will tell!

        "content": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates do not necessarily see eye-to-eye in a lot of things. Gates has shorted Tesla stock, and Musk has turned Gates into the butt of jokes several times online. The two billionaires also disagree on one specific thing — long-haul battery electric trucks.  Back in 2020, Gates penned an extensive blog post outlining his stance on the next generation of transportation. Gates was supportive of electric vehicles in his post, but he was very clear in the idea that he does not think batteries are a feasible solution for heavy-duty machinery. This includes Class 8 vehicles like the Tesla Semi. According to Gates, cheap alternative fuels are the way to go for large vehicles like 18-wheeler trucks. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “The problem is that batteries are big and heavy. The more weight you’re trying to move, the more batteries you need to power the vehicle. But the more batteries you use, the more weight you add—and the more power you need.  “Even with big breakthroughs in battery technology, electric vehicles will probably never be a practical solution for things like 18-wheelers, cargo ships, and passenger jets. Electricity works when you need to cover short distances, but we need a different solution for heavy, long-haul vehicles,” Gates wrote. Elon Musk responded to Gates’ criticisms later, noting that the Microsoft co-founder “has no clue.” And in a recent comment on Twitter, Musk noted that Gates could even drive the Tesla Semi if he wants. To be fair, that would be a pretty good way for Gates to experience just what large battery-electric vehicles could really do and perhaps be persuaded that such solutions are feasible. That is, of course, assuming that the Microsoft co-founder would be interested in personally driving the Semi. He can drive it himself if he wants!— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 27, 2022 The Tesla Semi is one of the company’s most doubted vehicles. After the vehicle’s unveiling, Chairman of the Board of Management of Daimler Truck AG Martin Daum joked that if Tesla could meet the Semi’s target specs, the vehicle would practically break the laws of physics. “If Tesla really delivers on this promise, we’ll obviously buy two trucks — one to take apart and one to test because if that happens, something has passed us by. But for now, the same laws of physics apply in Germany and in California,” Daum said. Considering that the Tesla Semi is set for its first deliveries on December 1, Daimler would probably have to place an order for the vehicle now. And as for Bill Gates, perhaps it would be great if he could try out the Semi for himself as well. That way, he can personally determine if Class 8 all-electric trucks are indeed legitimate or not.  Don’t hesitate to contact us with news tips.

        "content": "The Ford Mustang Mach-E is arguably one of the most popular EVs outside Teslas in the United States today, but Consumer Reports does not seem to be too impressed with the all-electric crossover for now. As per the magazine’s recent Auto Reliability Survey, Consumer Reports no longer counts the Ford Mustang Mach-E as one of its recommended vehicles. This is a blow to Ford’s electric crossover, especially since Consumer Reports just added the Mustang Mach-E to its list of recommended vehicles last year. The magazine noted then that its recommendation was due to the Mach E’s excellent reliability ratings that were earned from Consumer Reports’ surveys. The Mach-E also unseated the Tesla Model 3 as Consumer Reports’ Top EV Pick for 2022. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Ironically, this very reliability that caused the Mach-E to be added last year also caused the vehicle to lose its recommendation this time around. Mustang Mach-E owners reported issues with the display screen, which freezes up at times, as well as the vehicle’s charging system. Issues were also reported on the Mach-E’s electrical problems, and some also encountered battery issues.  Ford, for its part, has issued a statement on the matter. According to the veteran automaker, the issues that were outlined in Consumer Reports’ surveys have already been addressed. The company also made it a point to highlight that it is doing what it can to ensure that the Mach-E is steadily improved. “We listen to all customer feedback, including Consumer Reports and the concerns raised by customers. The survey results were from a population of vehicles early in the launch of these vehicles and those concerns have since been addressed. For Mach-E, we issued a recall for certain 2021 and 2022 vehicles. We updated software to prevent any damage to the contactors. In July, we rolled out an OTA (over the air) update that included improvements to plug and charge feature to increase successful charger activation rate,” Ford noted. While the Mach-E was the only electric car that lost its Consumer Reports recommendation in the magazine’s recent survey, it was not the only Ford that received a markdown. Joining the Mustang Mach-E is the 2023 Ford Bronco Sport, which lost its recommendation over a number of quality concerns, such as issues with its engine’s head gasket, braking system, and fit and finish, among others.

        "description": "Police cleared protesters in Shanghai who called for Xi's removal. Social media reports said protests spread to other cities, including Beijing,       ",
        "content": "SHANGHAI – Protesters pushed to the brink by China’s strict COVID measures in Shanghai called for the removal of the country’s all-powerful leader and clashed with police Sunday as crowds took to the streets in several cities in an astounding challenge to the government. Police forcibly cleared the demonstrators in China’s financial capital who called for Xi Jinping’s resignation and the end of the Chinese Communist Party’s rule — but hours later people rallied again in the same spot, and social media reports indicated protests also spread to at least seven other cities, including the capital of Beijing, and dozens of university campuses. Largescale protests are exceedingly rare in China, where public expressions of dissent are routinely stifled — but a direct rebuke of Xi, the country’s most powerful leader in decades, is extraordinary. Three years after the virus first emerged, China is the only major country still trying to stop transmission of COVID-19 – a “zero COVID” policy that regularly sees millions of people confined to their homes for weeks at a time and requires near-constant testing. The measures were originally widely accepted for minimizing deaths while other countries suffered devastating wavs of infections, but that consensus has begun to fray in recent weeks. Then on Friday, 10 people died in a fire in an apartment building, and many believe their rescue was delayed because of excessive lockdown measures. That sparked a weekend of protests, as the Chinese public’s ability to tolerate the harsh measures has apparently reached breaking point. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered late Saturday in Shanghai, which experienced a devastating lockdown in the spring in which people struggled to secure groceries and medicines and were forcefully taken into centralized quarantine. On a street named for the city in China’s far west where the fire happened, one group of protesters brought candles, flowers and signs honoring those who died in the blaze. Another, according to a protester who insisted on anonymity, was more active, shouting slogans and singing the national anthem. Video shows protesters chanting 'Xi Jinping! Step down!' In a video of the protest seen by The Associated Press, chants sounded loud and clear: “Xi Jinping! Step down! CCP! Step down!” Xi, arguably China’s most dominant leader since Mao Zedong, was recently named to another term as head of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, and some expect him to try to stay in power for life. The protester and another, who gave only his last name, Zhao, confirmed the chants. Both insisted on having their identities shielded because they fear arrest or retribution. The atmosphere of the protest encouraged people to speak about topics considered taboo, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in which the ruling Communist Party had ordered troops to fire on pro-democracy student demonstrators, the unnamed protester said. Some also called for an official apology for the deaths in the fire in Urumqi in the Xinjiang region. One member of the Uyghur ethnic group that is native to Xinjiang and has been the target of a sweeping security crackdown shared his experiences of discrimination and police violence. “Everyone thinks that Chinese people are afraid to come out and protest, that they don’t have any courage,” said the protester, who said it was his first time demonstrating. “Actually in my heart, I also thought this way. But then when I went there, I found that the environment was such that everyone was very brave.” Initially peaceful, the scene turned violent in the early hours of Sunday. Hundreds of police surrounded the protesters and broke up the first more active group before they came for the second as they tried to move people off the main street. The protester said that he saw multiple people being taken away, forced by police into vans, but could not identify them. The protester named Zhao said one of his friends was beaten by police and two were pepper sprayed. He said police stomped his feet as he tried to stop them from taking his friend away. He lost his shoes in the process, and left the protest barefoot. Zhao said protesters yelled slogans, including one that has become a frequent rallying cry: “(We) do not want PCR (tests), but want freedom.” On Sunday afternoon, crowds returned to the same spot and again railed against PCR tests. People stood and filmed as police started shoving at people. Deaths in apartment fire in Urumqi spark weekend of protest A crowdsourced list on social media showed that there were also demonstrations at 50 universities. Videos posted on social media that said they were filmed in Nanjing in the east, Guangzhou in the south, Beijing in the north and at least five other cities showed protesters tussling with police in white protective suits or dismantling barricades used to seal off neighborhoods. The Associated Press could not independently verify all the protests. In Beijing, students at the nation’s top college, Tsinghua University, held a demonstration Sunday afternoon in front of one of the school’s cafeterias. Three young women stood there initially with a simple message of condolence for the victims of the Urumqi apartment fire, according to a witness, who refused to be named out of fear of retribution, and images of the protest the AP has seen. Students shouted “freedom of speech” and sang the Internationale, the socialist anthem. The deputy Communist Party secretary of the school arrived at the protest, promising to hold a schoolwide discussion. Meanwhile, two cities in China’s northwest, where residents have been confined to their homes for up to four months, eased some anti-virus controls Sunday after public protests Friday. Meanwhile, Urumqi, where the fire occurred, as well as the smaller city of Korla were preparing to reopen markets and other businesses in areas deemed at low risk of virus transmission and to restart bus, train and airline service, state media reported. Wu reported from Taipei, Taiwan.",

        "content": "The idea of an Elon Musk-led company creating a smartphone has caught the imagination of many over the years, so much so that some YouTube channels continue to peddle the alleged release of products like the “Tesla Pi Phone” that’s supposedly poised to compete with Apple’s iPhone and other smartphones. (This may sound insane, but such videos are still garnering views until today.) But while such videos have become quite a running joke among those who closely follow Elon Musk and his projects, recent comments by the Tesla CEO suggest that a smartphone from a Musk-led company may not be too farfetched at all. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Musk has been neck-deep in controversy since he completed his acquisition of social media platform Twitter. Among his most recent controversial moves involved a poll which asked users of the platform if it would be a good idea to offer general amnesty to suspended accounts. The poll ended with users deciding that amnesty should be given. The people have spoken.Amnesty begins next week.Vox Populi, Vox Dei.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 24, 2022 Speaking to the Washington Post, Alejandra Caraballo, clinical instructor at Harvard Law’s cyberlaw clinic, called on Apple and Google to “seriously” start exploring the idea of kicking out Twitter from their respective app stores. Caraballo argued that Musk’s decisions on Twitter make the platform dangerous. “Apple and Google need to seriously start exploring booting Twitter off the app store. What Musk is doing is existentially dangerous for various marginalized communities. It’s like opening the gates of hell in terms of the havoc it will cause. People who engaged in direct targeted harassment can come back and engage in doxing, targeted harassment, vicious bullying, calls for violence, celebration of violence. I can’t even begin to state how dangerous this will be,” Caraballo said. Musk, for his part, has highlighted multiple times that Twitter would not tolerate hate speech or posts that instigate violence. These include recent calls to action from a group that invited people to attack Tesla stores to express their displeasure at Musk. I certainly hope it does not come to that, but, yes, if there is no other choice, I will make an alternative phone— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 25, 2022 The topic of Apple and Google potentially kicking off Twitter from their app stores was discussed thoroughly on the social media platform. It did not take long before some users like podcast host Liz Wheeler noted that if Twitter gets banned by Apple and Google, it would probably be a good idea for Musk to simply produce a smartphone himself. Musk responded positively to Wheeler’s post, noting that while he hopes Twitter does not get booted off the Apple and Android app stores, he would make an alternative phone if the need arises. “I certainly hope it does not come to that, but, yes, if there is no other choice, I will make an alternative phone,” Musk wrote.  Inasmuch as the idea of Musk creating a phone seems farfetched for now, the smartphone market would benefit with the addition of an alternative device simply because the segment has plateaued in the past years. A look at the iPhone’s significant but iterative improvements in its cameras and processors every year is a sign of this trend. The same is true on the Android side, with devices save for Samsung’s Fold series mostly focusing on iterative upgrades every year. Cyberphone #3 pic.twitter.com/qbWR8bnCpL— Jonas Daehnert (@PhoneDesigner) December 6, 2019 Plus, Musk’s companies tend to inspire people, which is one of the reasons why some concept artists have already toyed with the idea of a Tesla-inspired phone. Among these is concept creator Jonas Daehnert, who created a Cybertruck-inspired design for a potential smartphone following the all-electric pickup truck’s unveiling in late 2019. Daehnert’s design was met with much appreciation from social media users. One can only hope, of course, that Musk does not release such a device because of Twitter being banned by Apple and Google.
